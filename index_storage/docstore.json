Typically, the internship takes place in the city and state in which the student plans to live and work. Students earn three graduate-level credit hours for the internship, which runs from approximately January 1 through April 15. Because this internship is full-time, students may not take coursework concurrent to the internship. Following completion of the internship, students return to campus for nine credit hours of intensive coursework until mid-May. The busy season internship provides students with a realistic introduction to the accounting profession. Since seniority in most CPA firms is primarily measured by the number of busy seasons worked, graduates who pursue the internship will have a professional advantage over students who graduated the previous May. Students should seek approval forACCN\u00a07550from their MACCT faculty adviser.Prerequisite(s):(ACCN\u00a07110or4100) and (TAXN\u00a07100or4100).ACCN 7560Professional Accounting Internship(1-3)The corporate accounting internship lasts for at least 10 weeks and includes, but is not limited to, accounting-related functions in industry, banking, hospitals, government, not-for-profit, universities, CPA firms, or service organizations.

The two parts of the island evolved in unique ways, thus creating distinct but interconnected societies. In the east the plantation economy went into decline very early on, thus creating a remarkable rural society, the first in the Caribbean in which free people of African descent predominated; in the west, a brutal plantation regime ended in a spectacular slave revolt (The Haitian Revolution) that shook the foundations of the Atlantic world. Students will explore the Dominican-Haitian relationship from colonial times to present and highlight the ways that the DR and Haiti are interconnected and ways in which they have developed differently.AFRS 3722Blackness in Latin America(3)A principal idea in anthropology regarding identities is that they are created.

Given these bases for understanding identity, Blackness in Latin America will interpret the factors that have undergirded the formation of Black racial identities in different sites of the African Diaspora, and also how Black racial identities are used to redress political, social, and economic exclusion. We will focus on case studies in Latin America including Colombia, Honduras, Cuba,\nand Costa Rica. The course will additionally give attention to the Caribbean and its diaspora, including Trinidad, Jamaica, and also West Indians and Puerto Ricans in the U.S. Students will examine the ways in which racial identities\nare communicated looking in part at the transnational flows of information filtered through music, media, art, and literature that provide the \u201craw materials\u201d for identity construction, and political basis for their mobilization.AFRS 3750From Community to Stage(3)This course introduces students to the story circle methodology as formulated by the Free Southern Theater and Junebug Productions.

Issues to be addressed include Afrocentrism, Eurocentrism, ethnocentrism, multiculturalism, racism, sexism, gender, and class bias.AFRS 4400Afro-Brazilians(3)Once heralded internationally as a racial democracy, Brazil has been the subject of an ongoing critical re-evaluation that has revealed a vast gap between the national ideal and the social reality. The ideas of race and the various forms of institutional and quotidian racism in Brazil make for compelling contrasts and comparisons with the United States. This course will focus on a wide range of themes, issues, and problems in Afro-Brazilian Studies since the abolition of slavery in 1888. Combining cultural history, anthropology, sociology, literature, and popular music, this course will offer a multidisciplinary approach to black culture and race relations in Brazilian society.AFRS 4450Black Diasporic Culture(3)In this seminar students will look at Black cultural forms as they are created, shared, and participated in across national borders. In this process students will interpret the connections of Black culture shared across the diaspora to belonging, power, and practices of collective, and individual social resistance. We will also investigate the relationships that Black communities have with the nations in which they reside in efforts to understand why the transnational exchange becomes socially and politically important. In consideration of the ways in which Black culture takes shape and is shared transnationally the course will ask: What does it mean to think of Black culture as being transnational or diasporic? What are the political investments in the term \u201cBlack\u201d? What does \u201cBlack culture\u201d hope to explain? In addressing these questions, the seminar will engage transnational theory and discussions of art, politics, gender, sexuality, performance, and belief. The seminar takes a theoretical approach to understanding diasporic Black culture and incorporates case studies to root theory in everyday practice.AFRS 4560Internship(1-3)An experiential learning process coupled with pertinent academic course work.

Individuals and groups construct identities using a variety of forms of representation made available in music, media and various forms of cultural production, and in response to sociohistorical and political happenings. Experiences, both personal and collective, are also fodder for identity construction. Given these bases for understanding identity, Blackness in Latin America will interpret the factors that have undergirded the formation of Black racial identities in different sites of the African Diaspora, and also how Black racial identities are used to redress political, social, and economic exclusion. We will focus on case studies in Latin America including Colombia, Honduras, Cuba, and Costa Rica. The course will additionally give attention to the Caribbean and its diaspora, including Trinidad, Jamaica, and also West Indians and Puerto Ricans in the U.S. Students will examine the ways in which racial identities are communicated looking in part at the transnational flows of information filtered through music, media, art, and literature that provide the \u201craw materials\u201d for identity construction, and political basis for their mobilization.AFRS 7990Independent Study(1-4)", "start_char_idx": 15758, "end_char_idx": 18099, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c59f71bb-1d99-4d5e-8a0a-a563a89eb2db": {"__data__": {"id_": "c59f71bb-1d99-4d5e-8a0a-a563a89eb2db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Aging.txt", "file_name": "Aging.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4473, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0d13a8b-0bb2-4ea1-b6a9-d27efab608b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Aging.txt", "file_name": "Aging.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 4473, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "a0a93ea0900d2f7e1acfb4a1b869342dfec88a22d814d4ff8642be785da3ae20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "AGST 6200Advanced Research Methods and Design(3)In this course, students will be introduced to the strengths and limitations of various research techniques using examples based on psychological research.

We will examine a wide range of topics, such as hauntings, spirit possession, the role of evil in the moral imagination, and the construction of symbols as well as various practices associated healing, witchcraft (or sorcery) accusations, and the experience of suffering and death.  Anthropological approaches challenge the categories of \"religion\" and \"witchcraft\", which stem from Western conceptions of reality, Christianity, and ethnocentric views of the \"other\".ANTH 3240Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica(3)Survey of the ancient civilizations of Mexico and Central America. Overview of culture history from the first settled villages through the Spanish conquest. Special emphasis on the cultural developments of the Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, Toltec, and Aztec societies of highland Mexico, Gulf coast, and lowland Central America. Although the course stresses archaeological data, it will also include pre-Columbian aesthetic achievements, social organization, values, written records, and adaptation to varying environments.ANTH 3290The Nature of Language(3)Language as a reflection of the human mind and the role of language in defining the essence of humanity. Language and the expression of social values. Emphasis on analysis of primary linguistic data. Critical examination of theories of linguistic structure.ANTH 3300History of Writing(3,4)This course looks at the different systems of writing which have been used in various cultures through time with attention to the materials and purpose in relation to the cultures. Orientation to and practice in decipherment are included. Finally, the issues of modern script development are introduced.ANTH 3310Historical Linguistics(3,4)Survey of the field of paleopathology, the study of health and disease in ancient populations. Topics include methods for identifying evidence of injury and disease in bones, teeth, and mummified tissue; ancient medicine and surgery; chemical approaches to reconstructing diet; and human health trends through time.ANTH 3320Archaeology of Gender(3)Gender refers to the cultural norms, ideals, expectations, and rules that shape the relationships and activities of men, women, and children. People in the present and recent past have conceptualized gender in many different ways, and there is great diversity in the range of gender roles and gender relations seen in different cultures. With ethnographic and historic evidence as interpretive guides, archaeologists can offer insights into the nature of gender roles and gender relations in past societies, and into the ways that gender norms have contributed to major trends in the history and prehistory of humankind. This course is an introduction to the archaeological study of the roles of men, women, and children in past societies; the relationships among women, men, and children in past communities; and the ideologies that have legitimized and naturalized those gender roles and gender relations. Case studies covered in the course are drawn from the archaeology of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe.ANTH 3330Anthropology of Gender(3)A theoretical and ethnographical examination of how gender is constructed across cultures. Topics include sex and gender, gender identity, bodily experiences, masculinity and femininity, gender roles, kinship and gender, gender stratification, and gender equality, as well as gender, ethnicity, and class.ANTH 3350Culture and Religion(3)Religions, ideas, ritual, and organization of primitive peoples; nativistic and messianic movements; function of religion in social systems.ANTH 3360Anthropology of Cities(3)This course focuses on anthropological approaches to cities and urban life. Topics include the cultural meanings of public space and the built environment, processes of social differentiation and class formation, the role of capital, and the emergence of social movements. The second half of the course is organized around a comparison of four ethnographic case-studies of cities outside the United States and Europe. Throughout the semester, studies will also discuss how anthropological approaches may be applied to New Orleans.ANTH 3365The Anthropology of Sex Work(3)This course examines sex work as a form of labor in different sites around the world.", "start_char_idx": 11756, "end_char_idx": 16516, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d09b91e8-a3aa-429b-8864-3bd39f3a3264": {"__data__": {"id_": "d09b91e8-a3aa-429b-8864-3bd39f3a3264", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e932ca4b-3308-4f81-abd0-df28b58b68f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "ee0ae7925304f297211c4de098ff9c7c70a2c97a07ee6320c27cd06f5eb3c587", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20301d35-ac6b-4e87-8163-c9d3b3f5cec8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "284ce0c1358e9efc5eab39ee432d8c56e0edb8e627b9b731c984125d7a43b118", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e45e126f-36ba-4f28-be11-b8845465d76d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ab978c992fd744a0aa50330c35a69a539d75f7a197d268db8d634b351642327", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Topics include the cultural meanings of public space and the built environment, processes of social differentiation and class formation, the role of capital, and the emergence of social movements.

More specifically it explores what compels people to become involved in the industry, who its participants are, who seeks sex workers and why. It also considers the factors that impact the differing ways sex work is practiced and how it affects families. Tourism and its implications for sex work is an important focus of the course as well. The class proceeds as a survey of literature that will introduce students to relevant theories regarding sex work and ethnographic information that will help understand debates on its regulation and legalization. The latter part of the course will focus on these debates and moral, health, and human rights concerns. The case studies examined in the course take place primarily in the Caribbean and Latin America. As such, the course will ask important questions regarding the intersections of race, class, and sexual orientation with sex work and consider how these intersecting dynamics shape the experiences and decision making processes of both sex workers and their clientele.ANTH 3370Locating Southeast Asia(3,4)This course examines contemporary Southeast Asia. As one of the most diverse regions in the world, the region confounds easy characterization. The first part of the course provides students with a broad overview of the social, cultural, and political institutions of the region with a focus on Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The second part turns to contemporary issues including political and economic development, religious change, and cultural constructions of identity. Readings include academic essays, short stories, and full-length ethnographies.ANTH 3380Stone Age Europe(3)Europe\u2019s history is widely studied, but in terms of years, the continent\u2019s written record represents far less than 1% of the total time humans have lived there. In this course we explore the bulk of that vast (pre)history via the investigation of the Paleolithic (\u201cOld Stone Age\u201d) Mesolithic (\u201cMiddle Stone Age\u201d) and Neolithic (\u201cNew Stone Age\u201d). We begin with the first Homo erectus-like hominins who expanded into Europe as early as 1.7 million years ago, and examine the lifeways of European Neandertals and their presumed ancestors ca. 600,000 to 40,000 years ago. We then cover the arrival of our own species, Homo sapiens, around 54,000 years ago and explore interactions between them and the Neandertals. Around 20,000 years ago, the icy cold of the Last Glacial Maximum leads to the abandonment of northern Europe, while the end of the Last Ice Age ca. 11,700 BCE reforests the continent (bringing new challenges to the continent\u2019s Mesolithic inhabitants). The rapid spread of domestication from the Near East (the Neolithic) follows shortly thereafter, and in the Middle Neolithic megalithic monuments are built across the continent.ANTH 3385Creoles & Creolization(3)Overview of theory and ethnography of current and historic processes of sociocultural contact and comingling primarily in the New World African-European-Indigenous societies that result in emergent shared group identifications. The course examines how creolization allows for cultural continuity and creativity in such new social orders where a Creole language and/or identity may be formed. Admission: anthropology and linguistics majors at level of Jr. or above; graduate students; others by permission of instructorANTH 3395Ethnography of Performance and Identity in New Orleans and French Louisiana(3)This course focuses on symbolic meaning in the vernacular expressive culture or folkloric forms of community groups in New Orleans, French Louisiana, the Gulf South region and selected out migrant locations. It addresses differential identities of tribal, ethnic, regional, religious, linguistic, occupational, class and gender affiliations--and examines aesthetic forms as a primary means to do so. Some of these are largely intangible such as music and dance, ritual and festival, narrative and jokes; others are tangible or material culture to varying degrees such as the built environment (houses, boats, landscape use), crafts, costumes and cuisine.

All are examined via ethnographic and historical writing, oral histories and documentary media as to how shared cultural knowledge is performed in an array of contexts. These include dancehalls, Carnival parades, second lines, work settings, festivals, neighborhood museums, sacred spaces and so on.ANTH 3400Language and Culture(3)Language is created by people and is constantly changing as the people who speak it change and adapt to new ways of being.  Culture likewise is a creation of the interaction of people.  Language indexes the values, beliefs, practices, power relationships and social identities of its speakers.  This course will examine these facets of language use across a variety of cultures.ANTH 3420Semantics: Linguistic Approaches to Meaning(3)Semantics is the study of meaning in language.  As humans use language they produce meaning in any number of ways: through intonation, through body language, through contextual (in)congruities, and through the linguistic structures used.  Semanticians try to limit their study to the last of these, while always aware of other meaning-creating tools.  In this course, we begin with the study of logic-based theories of meaning, examining propositional meanings.  At each stage in this initial investigation, we will keep in mind how this carefully restricted corpus compares with situated language use.  In the second part of the course, we will systematically build in context to approach an understanding of natural semantics, the way human beings mean.ANTH 3430Archaeology of Cultural Landscapes(3)Landscapes are outcomes of natural and cultural activity.\u00a0 Natural landscapes are formed by geological processes and climatic patterns.\u00a0 Cultural landscapes are shaped by the intentional and unintentional effects of human activity on the environment.\u00a0 The archaeological study of cultural landscapes, therefore, concerns both the social and symbolic dimensions of local and regional environments as well as anthropogenic effects on environments at local, regional, and global scales.\u00a0 Archaeologists interested in cultural landscapes study features such as earthen mounds, embankments, monumental architecture, ritual places and cemeteries, the built environment of human settlements, canals, ditches, fields, and signs of human impacts on natural environments.\u00a0 Archaeologists typically study specific sites, but the archaeological study of landscapes emphasizes the significance of specific sites within broader regional contexts.\u00a0 An archaeological perspective benefits the study of landscapes because archaeologists are inherently interested in the effects of both long-term trends and short-term changes on the ways that groups of people interact with each other and with their environment.\u00a0 In this course, emphasis is placed on selected case studies from Europe, the North Atlantic, the South Pacific, and the Americas, although selected comparative cases and examples shall also be drawn from Africa and Asia.ANTH 3435Disasters and Past Societies(3)Consideration of case studies in how past societies have prepared for or responded to disasters, critical reflection on \"natural\" and \"cultural\" forces that contribute to catastrophic events and that shape the aftermath of disasters, comparative assessment of relationships between culture and environment, and application of resilience theory and models of cultural collapse towards understanding the effects of disasters on past societies.ANTH 3440Dialectology(3)Introduction to language variation both geographically and socially. The course looks at the history and methods of dialectology as well as the ways speakers demonstrate identity through speech patterns.ANTH 3441Lexicography(3)Lexicography is the making of dictionaries. Dictionaries take many forms and fulfill many functions. Dictionaries have evolved new formats; professional lexicographers share word gleaning with internet users. Dictionaries may be monolingual, di-, tri-, or multi-lingual, etymological or encyclopedic, synchronic or diachronic, prescriptive or descriptive, terminological or generic.

Dictionaries may be monolingual, di-, tri-, or multi-lingual, etymological or encyclopedic, synchronic or diachronic, prescriptive or descriptive, terminological or generic. Dictionary construction requires a number of skills which co-vary with the type of dictionary to be produced. This course provides an overview of dictionaries, their forms, formats and histories, while fostering a basic skill set for harvesting words and compiling lexicons. Dictionaries provide a cognitive map to communities of speakers, both past and present.ANTH 3450Methods of Observation in Behavioral Research(3)This course focuses on the development, design, analysis, and presentation of research on behavior using observational methods. While these methods can be used on captive populations (zoo, research center) they are also appropriate for studies of free-ranging animals, including human beings. The student will be exposed to the specific challenges of observational research, and learn appropriate levels of analysis.ANTH 3470Many Faces of Islam(3)Islam is a fundamental human experience in diverse socio-historic and cultural milieux. Ethnographies of Muslim communities highlight the heterogenity of Islamic perspectives and traditions. Focus on culturally situated Islamic practices and belief systems fosters a critical understanding of the emergent Islamic identities and their historico-cultural underpinnings.ANTH 3480African Modernities(3)This course focuses on the problem of conceptualizing modernity in Africa. Examining cases from throughout the continent, we will consider cultural developments such as romantic love, fashion, and consumption as well as new forms of religiosity and novel developments in established religions, economic change, state corruption, and violence.ANTH 3520Diaspora Yoruba(3)Familiarizes students with the fundamentals of Yoruba language and culture; shows students how Diaspora dynamics have changed Yoruba language and culture; uses Diaspora Yoruba to teach students the principles of language death and innovation involving tones, vowels, nasalization, word formation, and sentence structure.ANTH 3535Native American Language and Linguistics(3)This course will explore the richness of the linguistic diversity still preserved in the Native American languages of this hemisphere. Two thirds of the Native American languages spoken at time of European immigration have perished. Today even languages with large communities of fluent speakers face heavy assimilatory pressures. Language loss and simplification are rapidly changing the wordscape of the Americas.ANTH 3545Urban Music: Race Class and Sexuality(3)Urban Music: Race, Class, and Sexuality will examine how hip-hop and dancehall reggae music cultures are informed by racial and class identities, are used as tools to express these identities, and are mediums through which people address marginalization. The course will also consider how these music cultures are tied to representations of gender and sexuality, and the meaning that can be made from their connections. Through this exploration, students will analyze how music and performance can impact listeners in contradicting ways. For example: providing a sense of esteem and empowerment, but perhaps also perpetuating racial and gender stereotypes, and violence. As an overarching theme, the course will consider the ways in which popular cultural forms are political, and are reflections of society at large, therefore serving as important microcosms through which to interpret it.ANTH 3550Social Change, Sustainability, and Postcolonial Identity in the Caribbean(3)The St. Martin Program is an intensive, immersive service-learning program that combines a 3-credit class (ANTH\u00a03550: Social Change, Sustainability, and Postcolonial Identity in the  Caribbean) with community engagement. The course is based in the small binational island of St. Martin (Lesser Antilles). It includes a mandatory, zero-credit service-learning component, which will satisfy one tier of the public service graduation requirement. The primary purpose of the program is for students to meaningfully engage with locals, work and meet with community members committed to cultural, food, and economic sustainability, as well as gain an in-depth understanding of anthropological concepts and research methodology, especially as they relate to postcolonial contexts and the shaping of cultural/linguistic identities and socio- economic/political systems.ANTH 3560Environmental Archaeology(3)This course examines the fundamentally important relationship between human behavior and environmental change in the past.", "start_char_idx": 24169, "end_char_idx": 29175, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6993794-e985-45dd-aab4-acd3aeda4eb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6993794-e985-45dd-aab4-acd3aeda4eb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e932ca4b-3308-4f81-abd0-df28b58b68f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "ee0ae7925304f297211c4de098ff9c7c70a2c97a07ee6320c27cd06f5eb3c587", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3390aac-5811-4483-a662-e2d412b44f20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "1f23af252cad0c59c25d615e750bc63e871fd230d93791104f09cafbbacef54a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "463861ed-91a6-4289-9169-d90f04297b67", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c46e2a0ec7d89bdf6d9905a9a1d8d8ec7f9c50ecad90dc352c4393a6e46a7931", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Martin Program is an intensive, immersive service-learning program that combines a 3-credit class (ANTH\u00a03550: Social Change, Sustainability, and Postcolonial Identity in the  Caribbean) with community engagement.

Students will engage with critical perspectives on issues of positionality, reflexivity, representation, and embodiment, which are essential aspects in designing a research project, engaging in fieldwork, interpreting and analyzing data, and disseminating the research products. Throughout the course, we will analyze how each one of these issues and phases is enmeshed in interlocking power dynamics involving race, gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and nationality. We will interrogate the objectivity paradigm, learn about activist, collaborative, decolonizing, and Indigenous methodologies, their multiple challenges and critiques, and discuss anthropologists\u2019 reflections on their own fieldwork experiences. The main goal of the course is to guide students in the process of developing a creative, ethical approach to fieldwork.ANTH 3590Introduction To Syntax(3)Introduction of transformational generative syntax, with examples from selected areas of English grammar.

Surveys the history of the field and the techniques used to determine age, sex, and physical characteristics of an individual from skeletonized remains, as well as methods used for positive identification, estimating time since death, and determining cause and manner of death.ANTH 3735Bioarchaeology of Human Sacrifice(3)This course will examine the literary, archaeological, and skeletal evidence of human sacrifice in past societies.  It will critically review written accounts and physical evidence of the offering of human lives in ritual contexts, with a focus on archaeological sites that show convincing  evidence of such activities.  Case studies will be used to explore the question of why human lives were offered in particular places and times, while critically evaluating the evidence used to document and interpret such practices.ANTH 3745Bioarchaeology of Mummies(3,4)Mummified human remains open a fragile window into the past. They provide unique information about the physical characteristics, health and diet of ancient peoples, as well as information on cultural modification of the body (head shaping, piercing, tattooing, hair styles), funerary practices, and cultural concepts of death and the afterlife. Mummies can be investigated from various perspectives (textual, iconographic, biomedical, ethnographical, archaeological), but are studied most effectively using a multidisciplinary approach involving archaeologists, biological anthropologists, conservators, and specialists in medical imaging, paleogenetics and geochemistry. Bioarchaeology, the application of biological anthropology to archaeological research questions, is a term commonly used today to describe this multidisciplinary approach to studying the dead. This course will examine preserved human bodies from around the world, with an emphasis on scientific studies that seek to reconstruct their life histories and postmortem treatment.ANTH 3750Bones, Bodies and Disease(3)Survey of the field of paleopathology, the study of health and disease in ancient populations. Topics include methods for identifying evidence of injury and disease in bones, teeth, and mummified tissue; ancient medicine and surgery; chemical approaches to reconstructing diet; and human health trends through time.ANTH 3755Human Osteology(3)The objective of this course is to learn the anatomy of the human skeleton and dentition and the techniques physical anthropologists use to excavate, identify, and analyze human skeletal remains. You will learn how to identify the various bones of the skeleton, how to distinguish human from non-human bone, how to determine sex and estimate age at death; and how to measure bones in order to reconstruct living stature and physical characteristics from skeletal remains. Examples from archaeological excavations and forensic cases will be used to illustrate the kinds of information human skeletons can provide about ancient and modern populations. Practical and written exams and laboratory exercises hone your skills at recognizing anatomical landmarks, identifying fragmentary osteological material. measuring bones, and conducting a detailed skeletal inventory.ANTH 3760Primate Evolution and Adaptation(3)This course will focus on the anatomy, evolution and adaptive radiation of the Order Primates.

However, in order to reconstruct the phylogenetic (ancestor-descendent) relationships among humans, our ancestors, and close collateral relatives, we must group hominin fossils into meaningful taxonomic categories, ones that likely reflect truly monophyletic (shared common ancestor) descent patterns. This course explores different evolutionary species concepts and their applicability to human paleontology. Current approaches to the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships are then discussed, and the taxonomic status of hominin species is assessed.ANTH 4560Internship Studies(1-3)Internships in anthropology are available to qualified juniors and seniors on a limited basis for individual projects conducted in association with various private firms, public and private organizations, or governmental institutions in New Orleans.

This course provides a broad overview of the different sub-disciplinary approaches to knowledge of humans and our close relatives. Anthropological archaeology examines artifacts and other physical remains to construct a picture of lifeways. Biological Anthropology collates evidence from primatology, paleoanthropology, bioarchaeology, forensic science and biology. Linguistics studies natural human communication, aural-oral, gestural, and written, as well as exploring constructed languages, codes and analogous animal systems. Sociocultural anthropology encompasses both the specific and comparative study of contemporary human societies and cultures.ANTH 6010Quantitative Methods in ANTH(3)An introduction to mathematical methods relevant to anthropology.ANTH 6020The Neandertal Enigma(3)The Neandertals are the best-understood group of non-modern fossil hominids, having been known to science since 1856. Yet even today they inspire many provocative questions. Who were the Neandertals? How were they different from us? Did they have language? How and why did they disappear? Were they our ancestors, or did our ancestors out compete them? And if the Neandertals were not our ancestors, then who were? These are some of the questions we will explore in this class on the classic cavemen.ANTH 6060Ethnology of South America(3)Ethnology of the indigenous peoples of lowland South America and adjacent southern Central America.

The major goal of the course is to enhance our understanding of the diversity of people's engagement with the material world to shape social relations.  This course is also an attempt to re-connect sub-disciplines of anthropology (socio-cultural anthropology, archaeology, physical anthropology, and linguistics) and to build a general anthropology\" of material culture.

Topics include problems of adapting modern medicines to diverse cultures; explication of the social and cultural correlates of physical and mental health and disease (social epidemiology); cross-cultural variation in disease concepts, medical practices, role of patients, and mental health; health and nutritional implications of planned culture change; contributions of anthropology to health-policy decisions of development organizations.ANTH 6350Culture and Religion(3)Religions, ideas, ritual, and organization of primitive peoples; nativistic and messianic movements; function of religion in social systems.ANTH 6370Locating Southeast Asia(3)As one of the most diverse regions in the world, Southeast Asia confounds easy characterization. This course introduces students to the extraordinary diversity of Southeast Asian peoples, cultures, and political economy. We will locate the region through a comparative survey as well as through interdisciplinary and ethnographic inquiries that explore key elements of the region, including livelihoods, family ties, middle class aspirations, literature and music, rapid urbanization, economic transformations, and ecological challenges.ANTH 6380Stone Age Europe(3)Europe\u2019s history is widely studied, but in terms of years, the continent\u2019s written record represents far less than 1% of the total time humans have lived there. In this course we explore the bulk of that vast (pre)history via the investigation of the Paleolithic (\u201cOld Stone Age\u201d) Mesolithic (\u201cMiddle Stone Age\u201d) andNeolithic (\u201cNew Stone Age\u201d). We begin with the first Homo erectus-like hominins who expanded into Europe as early as1.7 million years ago, and examine the lifeways of European Neandertals and their presumed ancestors ca. 600,000 to40,000 years ago. We then cover the arrival of our own species, Homo sapiens, around 54,000 years ago and explore interactions between them and the Neandertals. Around 20,000 years ago, the icy cold of the Last Glacial Maximum leads to the abandonment of northern Europe, while the end of the Last Ice Age ca. 11,700 BCE reforests the continent(bringing new challenges to the continent\u2019s Mesolithic inhabitants).", "start_char_idx": 52215, "end_char_idx": 56866, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84c93096-d1e9-4fa3-80c5-02e9e2a25d84": {"__data__": {"id_": "84c93096-d1e9-4fa3-80c5-02e9e2a25d84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e932ca4b-3308-4f81-abd0-df28b58b68f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "ee0ae7925304f297211c4de098ff9c7c70a2c97a07ee6320c27cd06f5eb3c587", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ebb4cfd5-7239-457c-a353-ef83fa0324df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "d7ead1be35cddf1f5fb3402111708216880c38ba82166a6c3fb3137a497746b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a8a1e7c-5748-4046-b8a4-98aad043079a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7b418e35fa62d2c536a5d0f24679c204d1fe48d5545674d49e0af597ac91157b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In this course we explore the bulk of that vast (pre)history via the investigation of the Paleolithic (\u201cOld Stone Age\u201d) Mesolithic (\u201cMiddle Stone Age\u201d) andNeolithic (\u201cNew Stone Age\u201d).

The course examines how creolization allows for cultural continuity and creativity in such new social orders where a Creole language and/or identity may be formed. Admission: anthropology and linguistics majors at level of Jr. or above; graduate students; others by permission of instructorANTH 6395Ethnography of Performance and Identity in New Orleans and French Louisiana(3)This course focuses on symbolic meaning in the vernacular expressive culture or folkloric forms of community groups in New Orleans, French Louisiana, the Gulf South region and selected out migrant locations. It addresses differential identities of tribal, ethnic, regional, religious, linguistic, occupational, class and gender affiliations--and examines aesthetic forms as a primary means to do so. Some of these are largely intangible such as music and dance, ritual and festival, narrative and jokes; others are tangible or material culture to varying degrees such as the built environment (houses, boats, landscape use), crafts, costumes and cuisine. All are examined via ethnographic and historical writing, oral histories and documentary media as to how shared cultural knowledge is performed in an array of contexts. These include dancehalls, Carnival parades, second lines, work settings, festivals, neighborhood museums, sacred spaces and so on.ANTH 6400Language and Culture(3)Language is created by people and is constantly changing as the people who speak it change and adapt to new ways of being.  Culture likewise is a creation of the interaction of people.  Language indexes the values, beliefs, practices, power relationships and social identities of its speakers.  This course will examine these facets of language use across a variety of cultures.ANTH 6415Pidgins and Creoles(3)An overview of the world's pidgin and creole languages and a survey of the theories of their origins.

formed by geological processes and climatic patterns.\u00a0 Cultural landscapes are shaped by the intentional and unintentional effects of human activity on the environment.\u00a0 The archaeological study of cultural landscapes, therefore, concerns both the social and symbolic dimensions of local and regional environments as well as anthropogenic effects on environments at local, regional, and global scales.\u00a0 Archaeologists interested in cultural landscapes study features such as earthen mounds, embankments, monumental architecture, ritual places and cemeteries, the built environment of human settlements, canals, ditches, fields, and signs of human impacts on natural environments.\u00a0 Archaeologists typically study specific sites, but the archaeological study of landscapes emphasizes the significance of specific sites within broader regional contexts.\u00a0 An archaeological perspective benefits the study of landscapes because archaeologists are inherently interested in the effects of both long-term trends and short-term changes on the ways that groups of people interact with each other and with their environment.", "start_char_idx": 56068, "end_char_idx": 60703,

therefore, concerns both the social and symbolic dimensions of local and regional environments as well as anthropogenic effects on environments at local, regional, and global scales.\u00a0 Archaeologists interested in cultural landscapes study features such as earthen mounds, embankments, monumental architecture, ritual places and cemeteries, the built environment of human settlements, canals, ditches, fields, and signs of human impacts on natural environments.\u00a0 Archaeologists typically study specific sites, but the archaeological study of landscapes emphasizes the significance of specific sites within broader regional contexts.\u00a0 An archaeological perspective benefits the study of landscapes because archaeologists are inherently interested in the effects of both long-term trends and short-term changes on the ways that groups of people interact with each other and with their environment.\u00a0 In this course, emphasis is placed on selected case studies from Europe, the North Atlantic, the South Pacific, and the Americas, although selected comparative cases and examples shall also be drawn from Africa and Asia.ANTH 6435Disasters and Past Societies(3)Consideration of case studies in how past societies have prepared for or responded to disasters, critical reflection on \"natural\" and \"cultural\" forces that contribute to catastrophic events and that shape the aftermath of disasters, comparative assessment of relationships between culture and environment, and application of resilience theory and models of cultural collapse towards understanding the effects of disasters on past societies.ANTH 6480Human Functional Morphology(3)This course covers the functional anatomy of the human body, with emphasis on the structure, function, evolution, and development of the musculo-skeletal and nervous systems. The principle of biological uniformitarianism is used to correlate hard tissue (i.e., teeth and bone) structure with soft tissue function, since soft tissues are only rarely recovered in archaeological or paleontological settings.ANTH 6500Human Evolution(3)An investigation into the evolution of modern Homo sapiens (italics) over the last ten million years. Emphasis will be placed on the fossil record of human and nonhuman primates, the role of changing environments, and migration patterns. Models from technologically simple cultures and modern nonhuman primates will be included in the consideration of developing social organizations.ANTH 6520Ethnographic Methods(3)Theory and techniques involved in collecting, analyzing, and reporting ethnographic data. Validity, reliability, and precision of participant observation: probes and free lists; sampling frames and types of samples appropriate to the unit of analysis; surveys and questionnaires; selection of key informants; interdisciplinary methods; research design. Consideration of ethical issues, potential conflicts of interest, and university review board procedures and policies. Classroom exercises and field projects.ANTH 6545Urban Music: Race Class and Sexuality(3)Urban Music: Race, Class, and Sexuality will examine how hip-hop and dancehall reggae music cultures are informed by racial and class identities, are used as tools to express these identities, and are mediums through which people address marginalization. The course will also consider how these music cultures are tied to representations of gender and sexuality, and the meaning that can be made from their connections. Through this exploration, students will analyze how music and performance can impact listeners in contradicting ways. For example: providing a sense of esteem and empowerment, but perhaps also perpetuating racial and gender stereotypes, and violence. As an overarching theme, the course will consider the ways in which popular cultural forms are political, and are reflections of society at large, therefore serving as important microcosms through which to interpret it.ANTH 6570Indigenous Movements in Latin America(3)This course will give an overview of indigenous movements in Latin America and reflect on the advantages and shortcomings of these movements\u2019 recent approaches to rights discourses in the face of legal and extrajudicial forms of state violence. By comparing cases from Mexico, Guatemala, and Bolivia, we will analyze the connections between colonialism, the implementation of neoliberal policies, institutional racism, and states\u2019 recognition and application of indigenous rights.ANTH 6580The Politics of Fieldwork(3)This course will give an overview of some of the main discussions in anthropology around the theories, methods, and politics of ethnographic fieldwork. Students will engage with critical perspectives on issues of positionality, reflexivity, representation, and embodiment, which are essential aspects in designing a research project, engaging in fieldwork, interpreting and analyzing data, and disseminating the research products. Throughout the course, we will analyze how each one of these issues and phases is enmeshed in interlocking power dynamics involving race, gender, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and nationality.", "start_char_idx": 59645, "end_char_idx": 64931, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "462e75c8-bd48-4249-adcb-e731f6f87497": {"__data__": {"id_": "462e75c8-bd48-4249-adcb-e731f6f87497", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e932ca4b-3308-4f81-abd0-df28b58b68f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "ee0ae7925304f297211c4de098ff9c7c70a2c97a07ee6320c27cd06f5eb3c587", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a8a1e7c-5748-4046-b8a4-98aad043079a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "eb4f857e8035414f9cfeab81491b59b49cb8af9c3c1f7869ab501f1e8a42e1f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "61dc4c9e-2115-44a5-a8a1-dd7a6ada043c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ffd789139a24cbbd4d8abb7136ecb495874bf2dfd95f66840ee85888f6adac8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "By comparing cases from Mexico, Guatemala, and Bolivia, we will analyze the connections between colonialism, the implementation of neoliberal policies, institutional racism, and states\u2019 recognition and application of indigenous rights.ANTH 6580The Politics of Fieldwork(3)This course will give an overview of some of the main discussions in anthropology around the theories, methods, and politics of ethnographic fieldwork.

The main goal of the course is to guide students in the process of developing a creative, ethical approach to fieldwork.ANTH 6700Spoken Nahuatl(3)The essentials of Nahuatl phonology, morphology, and syntax. Conversational practice and laboratory sessions along with emphasis on linguistic analysis of the language.ANTH 6710Historical Ecology of Amazonia(3)Interactions between local peoples and Amazonian landscapes from prehistory to the present. Amazonian landscapes as an analytic unit will be examined from the interdisciplinary perspective of historical ecology. Changes and development of forests and savannas since the arrival of human beings. Historical, ecological, cultural forces involved in biological and edaphic diversity in modern forests. Long-term effects of prehistoric and historic human occupations and manipulation of landscapes. Implications for conservation and development.ANTH 6720Spoken Yoruba(3)This course provides an introduction to the Yoruba language. Emphasis on grammar and vocabulary development, listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Practice in oral discussion will be enhanced by weekly dramatical presentations, poetry recitals, and story-telling.ANTH 6745Bioarchaeology of Mummies(3)Mummified human remains open a fragile window into the past. They provide unique information about the physical characteristics, health and diet of ancient peoples, as well as information on cultural modification of the body (head shaping, piercing, tattooing, hair styles), funerary practices, and cultural concepts of death and the afterlife. Mummies can be investigated from various perspectives (textual, iconographic, biomedical, ethnographical, archaeological), but are studied most effectively using a multidisciplinary approach involving archaeologists, biological anthropologists, conservators, and specialists in medical imaging, paleogenetics and geochemistry. Bioarchaeology, the application of biological anthropology to archaeological research questions, is a term commonly used today to describe this multidisciplinary approach to studying the dead. This course will examine preserved human bodies from around the world, with an emphasis on scientific studies that seek to reconstruct their life histories and postmortem treatment.ANTH 6770Global Vietnam(3)In this class, we draw on a variety of resources\u2014historical essays, short\nstories, ethnographic essays, memoirs, and videos\u2014in order to gain a better understanding of how refugees, migrants, and their children are forging their sense of self in order to become Vietnamese anew in places far from their presumed geographic home. We will use global Vietnamese communities as case-studies to explore theoretical concepts around critical refugee studies, diaspora, and transnationalism.ANTH 6800Spoken Yucatecan Maya(3)The essentials of Yucatecan Maya phonology, morphology, and syntax. Oral/aural exercises and conversational practice with a native speaker.ANTH 6810Introduction to Maya Hieroglyphs(3)A survey of present knowledge about the nature of the pre-Columbian Maya writing system, including calendrical notation, astronomical calculations, the structure and content of phoneticism, and its relationship to other Mesoamerican writing systems.ANTH 6840Beginning Kaqchikel (Maya) Language(3,4)Kaqchikel is one of the four largest Mayan groups in Guatemala, having over a million self-identified members, about half of whom speak their native mother tongue.

Designing research plans and making linkages between theory, strategies of inquiry, specific methodologies, and empirical datasets is both challenging and rewarding, and research design can take considerable amounts of time and effort. Crafting research proposals can also be both challenging and rewarding, especially given the need to communicate research plans to specialists in particular disciplines and proposal reviewers from fields of study and practice other than our own. Each student in this course will develop theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches that form the basis for the research she or he plans to conduct as a dissertation project. Each student will write a draft a proposal for dissertation research. Some discussion throughout the course will be devoted to professional development and to specific funding programs that support doctoral and postdoctoral research in anthropology and related fields of study.ANTH 7240Ancient Civilizations of Mesoamerica(3)Survey of the ancient civilizations of Mexico and Central America. Overview of culture history from the first settled villages through the Spanish conquest. Special emphasis on the cultural developments of the Olmec, Zapotec, Maya, Toltec, and Aztec societies of highland Mexico, Gulf coast, and lowland Central America. Although the course stresses archaeological data, it will also include pre-Columbian aesthetic achievements, social organization, values, written records, and adaptation to varying environments.ANTH 7250Selected Research Topics(3)Selected Research Topics.ANTH 7290Linguistic Analysis(3)Language as a reflection of the human mind and the role of language in defining the essence of humanity. Language and the expression of social values. Emphasis on analysis of primary linguistic data. Critical examination of theories of linguistic structure.ANTH 7300History of Writing(3)This course looks at the different systems of writing which have been used in various cultures through time with attention to the materials and purpose in relation to the cultures. Orientation to and practice in decipherment are included. Finally, the issues of modern script development are introduced.ANTH 7310Prehistory of Languages(3)Historical Linguistics traces language change over time. Reconstruction through comparative method and internal paradigm examination is used to retro-project earlier stages of a language or a language family, elucidating interrelationships among languages, paths of migration, spheres of influence, and varieties of contact. Reconstructed vocabulary yields inferences about ancient homelands, social organization, and culture constructs. The processes observed in language change yield insights into human cognition and the language faculty.ANTH 7320Archaeology of Gender(3)Gender refers to the cultural norms, ideals, expectations, and rules that shape the relationships and activities of men, women, and children. People in the present and recent past have conceptualized gender in many different ways, and there is great diversity in the range of gender roles and gender relations seen in different cultures. With ethnographic and historic evidence as interpretive guides, archaeologists can offer insights into the nature of gender roles and gender relations in past societies, and into the ways that gender norms have contributed to major trends in the history and prehistory of humankind. This course is an introduction to the archaeological study of the roles of men, women, and children in past societies; the relationships among women, men, and children in past communities; and the ideologies that have legitimized and naturalized those gender roles and gender relations. Case studies covered in the course are drawn from the archaeology of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe.ANTH 7330Anthropology of Gender(3)Introduction to forensic anthropology, a subdiscipline of physical anthropology concerned with the identification of human skeletal remains in medico-legal contexts. Surveys the history of the field and the techniques used to determine age, sex, and physical characteristics of an individual from skeletonized remains, as well as methods used for positive identification, estimating time since death, and determining cause and manner of death.ANTH 7340Dialectology(3)Introduction to language variation both geographically and socially.", "start_char_idx": 75383, "end_char_idx": 80532, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87e8a168-99e0-48f4-80a1-2aeb73579373": {"__data__": {"id_": "87e8a168-99e0-48f4-80a1-2aeb73579373", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e932ca4b-3308-4f81-abd0-df28b58b68f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "ee0ae7925304f297211c4de098ff9c7c70a2c97a07ee6320c27cd06f5eb3c587", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ad6489d-f3c5-4b8f-bf6d-7ad955e7157c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "3721a47ceb6f79e40bac470beca13d685677977f66c3ecc32e7a0c7d9d36a026", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f958721-cf95-4e85-a88b-00b26f2ad874", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72f64237c1d1bae52cfd0c1934eb630fe015630f6c55636cb01711d80e37b6bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This course is an introduction to the archaeological study of the roles of men, women, and children in past societies; the relationships among women, men, and children in past communities; and the ideologies that have legitimized and naturalized those gender roles and gender relations.

The course looks at the history and methods of dialectology as well as the ways speakers demonstrate identity through speech patterns.ANTH 7360Anthropology of Cities(3)This course focuses on anthropological approaches to cities and urban life. Topics include the cultural meanings of public space and the built environment, processes of social differentiation and class formation, the role of capital, and the emergence of social movements. The second half of the course is organized around a comparison of four ethnographic case-studies of cities outside the United States and Europe. Throughout the semester, studies will also discuss how anthropological approaches may be applied to New Orleans.ANTH 7365The Anthropology of Sex Work(3)This course examines sex work as a form of labor in different sites around the world. More specifically it explores what compels people to become involved in the industry, who its participants are, who seeks sex workers and why. It also considers the factors that impact the differing ways sex work is practiced and how it affects families. Tourism and its implications for sex work is an important focus of the course as well. The class proceeds as a survey of literature that will introduce students to relevant theories regarding sex work and ethnographic information that will help understand debates on its regulation and legalization. The latter part of the course will focus on these debates and moral, health, and human rights concerns. The case studies examined in the course take place primarily in the Caribbean and Latin America. As such, the course will ask important questions regarding the intersections of race, class, and sexual orientation with sex work and consider how these intersecting dynamics shape the experiences and decision making processes of both sex workers and their clientele.ANTH 7370Locating Southeast Asia(3)This course examines contemporary Southeast Asia. As one of the most diverse regions in the world, the region confounds easy characterization. The first part of the course provides students with a broad overview of the social, cultural, and political institutions of the region with a focus on Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The second part turns to contemporary issues including political and economic development, religious change, and cultural constructions of identity. Readings include academic essays, short stories, and full-length ethnographies.ANTH 7400Language & Culture(3)Language is created by people and is constantly changing as the people who speak it change and adapt to new ways of being.  Culture likewise is a creation of the interaction of people.  Language indexes the values, beliefs, practices, power relationships and social identities of its speakers.  This course will examine these facets of language use across a variety of cultures.ANTH 7410Prehistory of Eastern Mesoamerica(3)Examines the development of highly advanced cultures and societies in one of the centers of native American civilization. Although the presentation stresses archaeological data, the course considers pre-Hispanic aesthetic achievements, social organization, values, written records, and adaptation to varying environments.ANTH 7420Semantics: Linguistic Approaches to Meaning(3)Semantics is the study of meaning in language.  As humans use language they produce meaning in any number of ways: through intonation, through body language, through contextual (in)congruities, and through the linguistic structures used.  Semanticians try to limit their study to the last of these, while always aware of other meaning-creating tools.  In this course, we begin with the study of logic-based theories of meaning, examining propositional meanings.  At each stage in this initial investigation, we will keep in mind how this carefully restricted corpus compares with situated language use.  In the second part of the course, we will systematically build in context to approach an understanding of natural semantics, the way human beings mean.ANTH 7441Lexicography:  Dictionaries(3)Lexicography is the making of dictionaries.", "start_char_idx": 79568, "end_char_idx": 84654, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f958721-cf95-4e85-a88b-00b26f2ad874": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f958721-cf95-4e85-a88b-00b26f2ad874", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e932ca4b-3308-4f81-abd0-df28b58b68f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "ee0ae7925304f297211c4de098ff9c7c70a2c97a07ee6320c27cd06f5eb3c587", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "87e8a168-99e0-48f4-80a1-2aeb73579373", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "277168591a6b1bb2d88bbd8691e64d0b08e85dd8b5f8de1f0d703122123da23e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "05d3526b-facd-4fe7-bf43-bec95f5dc83d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6531c11ebd5e1b6c12c9dd7b731476c404fbe8b40014e7686b9148e875e4ebe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As humans use language they produce meaning in any number of ways: through intonation, through body language, through contextual (in)congruities, and through the linguistic structures used.

Dictionaries take many forms and fulfill many functions. Dictionaries have evolved new formats; professional lexicographers share word gleaning with internet users. Dictionaries may be monolingual, di-, tri-, or multi-lingual, etymological or encyclopedic, synchronic or diachronic, prescriptive or descriptive, terminological or generic. Dictionary construction requires a number of skills which co-vary with the type of dictionary to be produced. This course provides an overview of dictionaries, their forms, formats and histories, while fostering a basic skill set for harvesting words and compiling lexicons. Dictionaries provide a cognitive map to communities of speakers, both past and present.ANTH 7450Methods of Observation in Behavioral Research(3)This course focuses on the development, design, analysis, and presentation of research on behavior using observational methods. While these methods can be used on captive populations (zoo, research center) they are also appropriate for studies of free-ranging animals, including human beings. The student will be exposed to the specific challenges of observational research, and learn appropriate levels of analysis.ANTH 7470Many Faces of Islam(3)Islam is a fundamental human experience in diverse socio-historic and cultural milieux. Ethnographies of Muslim communities highlight the heterogenity of Islamic perspectives and traditions. Focus on culturally situated Islamic practices and belief systems fosters a critical understanding of the emergent Islamic identities and their historico-cultural underpinnings.ANTH 7510Fossil Hominin Taxonomy and Systematics(3)The number of proposed fossil hominid/hominin species has mushroomed in recent years yet the recognition of species in the human fossil record remains a daunting task. However, in order to reconstruct the phylogenetic (ancestor-descendent) relationships among humans, our ancestors, and close collateral relatives, we must group hominin fossils into meaningful taxonomic categories, ones that likely reflect truly monophyletic (shared common ancestor) descent patterns. This course explores different evolutionary species concepts and their applicability to human paleontology. Current approaches to the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships are then discussed, and the taxonomic status of hominin species is assessed.ANTH 7535Native American Language and Linguistics(3)This course will explore the richness of the linguistic diversity still preserved in the Native American languages of this hemisphere. Two thirds of the Native American languages spoken at time of European immigration have perished. Today even languages with large communities of fluent speakers face heavy assimilatory pressures. Language loss and simplification are rapidly changing the wordscape of the Americas.ANTH 7560Environmental Archaeology(3)This course examines the fundamentally important relationship between human behavior and environmental change in the past. It looks at both the ways in which humans have responded to their environmental circumstances and the ways in which human activities have influenced environmental conditions at various scales. The course explores methods for learning about environmental conditions in the past and the nature of human interaction with the environment. The course also presents basic information on some particularly important topics concerning past human/environment interactions, including (1) causes of global climate change, (2) human roles in Pleistocene megafauna, (3) post-Pleistocene adaptation, (4) the origins of agriculture and animal domestication, (5) agricultural landscape modification and environmental over-exploitation, and (6) Holocene changes in human health, including the origins of modern disease epidemics.ANTH 7570Intermediate Kaqchikel Language(3)Kaqchikel is one of the four largest Mayan groups in Guatemala, having over a million self-identified members, about half of whom speak their native mother tongue.", "start_char_idx": 83865, "end_char_idx": 88649, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05d3526b-facd-4fe7-bf43-bec95f5dc83d": {"__data__": {"id_": "05d3526b-facd-4fe7-bf43-bec95f5dc83d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e932ca4b-3308-4f81-abd0-df28b58b68f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "ee0ae7925304f297211c4de098ff9c7c70a2c97a07ee6320c27cd06f5eb3c587", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f958721-cf95-4e85-a88b-00b26f2ad874", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Anthropology.txt", "file_name": "Anthropology.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 98251, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "ab6c0fc21951b2426042d54acf1f5f0573550aa5db46871746fec081e75e60f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e2d94bbe-6702-4f1d-ae3d-491371198933", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f00f27c2a9cb27802622b72f10aeed362747778ebc09dea228ce4fc48a008e2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It looks at both the ways in which humans have responded to their environmental circumstances and the ways in which human activities have influenced environmental conditions at various scales.

Formal models in grammatical description. Emphasis on the logic of linguistic argumentation.ANTH 7610Ceramic Analysis(3)A laboratory course dealing with the descriptive analysis of archaeological ceramics. Introduction to aspects of ceramic technology, classification, description, and the use of ceramics in archaeological research. Emphasis will be on practical methods and techniques for analyzing, describing, reporting, and graphically representing ceramic artifacts.ANTH 7620Lithic Analysis(3)A laboratory course dealing with the technological analysis of lithic artifacts. Introduction to fracture mechanics and flint napping, debitage analysis and classification. Application of principles and methods of technological classification, description, and graphical representation to archaeological specimens and modern replicates.ANTH 7630Linguistic Phonetics(3)The course offers an overview of articulatory and acoustic phonetics with emphasis on matching acoustic cues closely with the articulatory gestures. The first part of the course will study the articulatory and acoustic cues to range of English and non-English speech sounds with information about the normal range of variation. The second part will focus on collecting and interpreting acoustic data, and using such data as evidence to solve phonological problems in normal and pathological speech.ANTH 7640Phonology(3)This course provides an introduction to phonological analysis and theory, with strong emphasis on description and analysis of data from a wide variety of languages. Major issues to be addressed include universal principles of human phonological systems, language-specific variation, constraints on representation of rules, the relationship of phonology to morphological and syntactic components of the grammar, and the historical underpinnings of current theoretical models.ANTH 7650Morphology(3)This course provides an introduction to prosodic and non-prosodic morphology with emphasis on data analysis and argumentation. With data from a variety of languages, the first part of the course will examine non-prosodic morphological processes to highlight the typology of word structure across languages. The second part will examine morphological processes conditioned by prosody, and consider the various frameworks for analyzing the data; eventually, the course will work toward a dormal model like that of McCarth and Prince's \"Theory of Prosodic Morphology\".

The course serves as both a required foundation for architecture majors/minors and as a general introduction to architectural thought for non-majors. Architecture is a notoriously vast subject with many areas of consensus and a few areas of serious contention. This course will present a generalized framework of architectural thought and help to understand works of architecture and design in the larger cultures they serve.ARCH 1111Topics in Architecture History/Theory(1.5)This is one of four required half-semester courses introducing students to architectural history and theory by exposing them to a broad range of architectural origins, buildings examples and influences. The goal of the architecture history and theory course sequence is to prepare students to become accomplished researchers\u2014well able to connect a useful taxonomy of architectural examples to contemporary issues and ambitions. Each of the courses begins with a contemporary figure in architectural practice and proceeds in a reverse chronology to explore the precedents and linages of thought that have been synthesized in the work of that contemporary practice. Teaching by example, these courses will offer a lesson in how distant antecedents support and continue to inform the discipline today. By exploring both a western and a non-western canon from a broader range of voices and vantage points, students will learn to further contextualize the basic architectural vocabulary acquired in their introductory courses.

Each of the courses begins with a contemporary figure in architectural practice and proceeds in a reverse chronology to explore the precedents and linages of thought that have been synthesized in the work of that contemporary practice. Teaching by example, these courses will offer a lesson in how distant antecedents support and continue to inform the discipline today. By exploring both a western and a non-western canon from a broader range of voices and vantage points, students will learn to further contextualize the basic architectural vocabulary acquired in their introductory courses.

Corequisite(s):ARCH\u00a02113.Corequisite(s):ARCH\u00a02113.ARCH 2122History and Theory of Architecture and Urbanism II(3)The course covers the period from the Enlightenment through the early-Modern and high-Modern periods. While the course will emphasize the late-eighteenth (Enlightenment) creation of canonical pedagogies and strategies as foundational texts, it will also include nineteenth-century urbanism and landscapes, both of which condition the formation of material culture in the early- and mid-twentieth centuries. The course is written expressly for students of architecture; we will concentrate not only on the identification and formation of urban artifacts, buildings, architects, and movements, but also on the social, political, and historical context surrounding their genesis and development. The course material is presented according to successive themes, thereby facilitating not only an emphasis on the artifacts and their context, but also on the discourse that supports architecture as a discipline. These themes provide insight into the various motivations and ideas, upon which the history of Modern Architecture rests. In presenting the material in this manner, it is hoped that students will understand that history--in particular the history embedded in the material of architecture--indeed resonates through time, becoming relevant and vital to the genesis and formation of current and future architectural discourse.Prerequisite(s):ARCH\u00a01121or AHST 3010.ARCH 2211Site Strategies(3)Site Strategies is designed to prepare students of Architecture for site analysis prior to placing architectural projects in urban and non-urban contexts.

After a discussion of some basic concepts and terms we sketch a broad outline of the categories and organization of the discipline of philosophy. We then study the rationalist and empiricist positions in architectural theory, the emergence of Kantian critical philosophy, the shift in emphasis in 20th century philosophy from epistemology to ontology that is characteristic of Existentialism, and the late 20th century attack on traditional epistemology characteristic of poststructuralism. We then discuss the emergence of literary theory as a paradigmatic discipline in the last 30 years as well as the expansion of western philosophy to include aspects of Zen Buddhism, Taoism, and eastern mystical traditions. With this foundation, the course focuses more specifically on theories of architecture and aesthetics and their relationships to various philosophical positions.Prerequisite(s):ARCH\u00a01111,1112,2113,2114or1121.ARCH 3150Identity & Agency in Architecture(3)This course confronts the simple fact that the practice of architecture has a substantial diversity deficit among its professionals and argues that this has negative impacts for design of our built environment.

Together, we will reshape our own experiences of the built environment and how we envision its creators. Twenty hours of service learning working with our partners in architectural studies, fieldtrips, and an exhibit installation is required. Students do not need to be architecture majors to take this course, but they must possess a seriousness of interest and intent to contribute meaningfully to both the academic and service aspects of the course.ARCH 3214Structural Systems(4)This course teaches students about the performance of structural framing systems in buildings. Students gain an understanding of the relationships amongst parameters of structural framing systems and their impact on design decisions. The course covers the effects of gravitational and lateral structural loads on framing members, connections and foundation, investigated through quantitative analysis.Prerequisite(s):PHYS\u00a01050,1210or1310.ARCH 3215Integrated Building Systems(4)Prerequisite(s): (ARCH\u00a02211* or ATCS 3010*) and (ARCH\u00a02212* or ATCS 3020*) and (ARCH\u00a02213* or ATCS 3030*) and (ARCH\u00a03214* or ATCS 4010*).\n* May be taken concurrently.Prerequisite(s):(ARCH\u00a02211*or ATCS 3010*) and (ARCH\u00a02212*or ATCS 3020*) and (ARCH\u00a02213*or ATCS 3030*) and (ARCH\u00a03214*or ATCS 4010*).*May be taken concurrently.ARCH 3233Energy Modeling(3)The application of building modeling using computer simulation tools plays an integral role in the design and evaluation of energy efficient and sustainable buildings. Architects use these simulation to understand and assess building performance at various stages of the design process. A basic understanding of energy systems, and the ability to design and manipulate them, will be especially important as we move into a future where climate change has become a reality, and environmental regulations on the built environment will tighten.ARCH 3234Tectonics of Anisotropic Material Properties(3)This seminar focuses on the tectonic characteristics of component assembly through the lens of anisotropic material properties. Our goal is to gain insight into how the visual intention and the material execution are reconciled through the design and construction process, informing the tectonics of the assembly as a whole.ARCH 3239Space Arch/Walking Cities/Fut.(3)ARCH 3312Advanced Digital Media(3)The second course of the digital media sequence covers advance techniques for digital drawing, modeling, and image production. Students will continue to explore techniques for orthographic, axonometric, and perspective projection drawing.

After a discussion of some basic concepts and terms we sketch a broad outline of the categories and organization of the discipline of philosophy. We then study the rationalist and empiricist positions in architectural theory, the emergence of Kantian critical philosophy, the shift in emphasis in 20th century philosophy from epistemology to ontology that is characteristic of Existentialism, and the late 20th century attack on traditional epistemology characteristic of poststructuralism. We then discuss the emergence of literary theory as a paradigmatic discipline in the last 30 years as well as the expansion of western philosophy to include aspects of Zen Buddhism, Taoism, and eastern mystical traditions. With this foundation, the course focuses more specifically on theories of architecture and aesthetics and their relationships to various philosophical positions.\n\nPrerequisite(s):ARCH\u00a02122or AHST 3020.Prerequisite(s):ARCH\u00a02122or AHST 3020.ARCH 3731Urban Geography and New Orleans as a Case Study(4)Same as PreviousARCH 3742Design in Public Interest(3)Prerequisite(s):ARCH\u00a01110or AHST 1110.Prerequisite(s):ARCH\u00a01110or AHST 1110.Corequisite(s):ARCH\u00a03890.ARCH 3764NOLA Geography for Architects(3)ARCH 3771Latin Amer.

These discussions can happen at the scale of a profession, an industry association, or an individual firm--but too often we are more comfortable using only the language of business or economics in a business setting, and so avoid ethical or values-based discussions. And yet, any group of professionals is hired both for their skill and for their judgment. This course will evaluate ethical and public policy dilemmas in the built environment, building a fluency with this language in a professional context. We will identify genuine moral dilemmas in current professional practice and connect them to underlying professional values. In doing so, we will consider the effects of decisions nominally made by senior practitioners and principals; but we will also emphasize opportunities for more junior professionals to instigate a discussion of professional ethics in their own firm or professional setting.ARCH 4550Career Development Lab(1)ARCH 4552Urbanbuild Professionalism(3)ARCH 4560Architecture Internship(3)Maximum Hours:99ARCH 4570Architecture CPS Internship(3)ARCH 4890Service Learning(0-1)Students complete a service activity in the community in conjunction with the content of a three-credit co-requisite course.

This course is global in focus, including both Western and non-Western developments. The survey highlights a variety of aspects of the built environment such as architecture, urban settlements and landscapes. Coursework investigates monumental civic architecture, religious structures, as well as domestic buildings, the urban form, and architectural theory.ARCH 6122History and Theory of Architecture and Urbanism II(3)The course covers the period from the Enlightenment through the early-Modern and high-Modern periods. While the course will emphasize the late-eighteenth (Enlightenment) creation of canonical pedagogies and strategies as foundational texts, it will also include nineteenth-century urbanism and landscapes, both of which condition the formation of material culture in the early- and mid-twentieth centuries. The course is written expressly for students of architecture; we will concentrate not only on the identification and formation of urban artifacts, buildings, architects, and movements, but also on the social, political, and historical context surrounding their genesis and development. The course material is presented according to successive themes, thereby facilitating not only an emphasis on the artifacts and their context, but also on the discourse that supports architecture as a discipline. These themes provide insight into the various motivations and ideas, upon which the history of Modern Architecture rests. In presenting the material in this manner, it is hoped that students will understand that history--in particular the history embedded in the material of architecture--indeed resonates through time, becoming relevant and vital to the genesis and formation of current and future architectural discourse.ARCH 6130Architectural Research Methods(3)This course introduces students to various research paradigms to engage and produce architectural scholarship. Architectural Research Methods will include\nweekly readings and written responses, a literature review of relevant texts, and a proposal for a research topic. Students will develop skills necessary to support their work in research-based Options Studios and other courses with expectations for scholarly outcomes.ARCH 6133Museums: History, Design, Culture(3)This seminar-style course investigates museums as preeminent cultural institutions of the 21st century. It is developed in weekly modules through substantive readings and case studies that range across architectural and programmatic typologies, sites and contexts, functional requirements, and theories and practices of display. The geographic reach of the course is international. Selected readings focus on the institutional development of museums, the roles that museums play in the construction of individual and communal identities, and the contributions that museums make particularly to urban cultural economies. Readings also address current research concerning the development of new museum publics through the application of cutting-edge digital technologies and web-based applications.ARCH 6140Sectional Strategies(3)The seminar explores spatial and social themes that are revealed and explored through the vertical cut of the section. Lectures, readings and student presentations will look at both historic and contemporary projects for buildings, cities and landscapes.ARCH 6142Contemporary Swiss Architecture(3)This seminar will explore significant achievements in contemporary Swiss architecture focusing on the work of Peter Zumthor, Herzog & de Meuron, and Gion Caminada.

By studying a relatively limited number of key buildings and architects, the seminar will engage broader discussions regarding contemporary architectural practice in general. Where helpful or relevant, works of architecture from various global settings and time periods will be referenced.ARCH 6144Philosophies of Architecture(3)This seminar begins with a consideration of philosophy as a foundation for the development of an architectural theory. After a discussion of some basic concepts and terms we sketch a broad outline of the categories and organization of the discipline of philosophy. We then study the rationalist and empiricist positions in architectural theory, the emergence of Kantian critical philosophy, the shift in emphasis in 20th century philosophy from epistemology to ontology that is characteristic of Existentialism, and the late 20th century attack on traditional epistemology characteristic of poststructuralism. We then discuss the emergence of literary theory as a paradigmatic discipline in the last 30 years as well as the expansion of western philosophy to include aspects of Zen Buddhism, Taoism, and eastern mystical traditions. With this foundation, the course focuses more specifically on theories of architecture and aesthetics and their relationships to various philosophical positions.ARCH 6150Identity & Agency in Architecture(3)This course confronts the simple fact that the practice of architecture has a substantial diversity deficit among its professionals and argues that this has negative impacts for design of our built environment. Winston Churchill famously said, \"We shape our buildings. Thereafter, they shape us.\" So what is the impact when our built environment is shaped through the lens of only one part of our population? How does the result shape the rest of us? This course delves into the interplay between identity and the built environment in the United States, both in the historical context and today. It focuses on how underrepresented people have and have not had voice and agency in the shaping of the American built environment and explores future potentials for a built environment that is more reflective of, and improved by, a multiplicity of identities. This is a seminar and a service learning course in which we will use both the readings and discussion of a traditional seminar and the outside-of-the-classroom engagement of service learning to understand the paradigm that we are studying and attempt to change the narrative. By bringing architectural studies to 11-13 year-old students who might not otherwise have direct access to them, we will shift the potential of identity and agency in the built environment of tomorrow. At the same time, we will learn about the built environment through the perspectives of our younger co-learners. Together, we will reshape our own experiences of the built environment and how we envision its creators. Twenty hours of service learning working with our partners in architectural studies, fieldtrips, and an exhibit installation is required. Students do not need to be architecture majors to take this course, but they must possess a seriousness of interest and intent to contribute meaningfully to both the academic and service aspects of the course.ARCH 6211Site Strategies(3)Site Strategies is designed to prepare students of Architecture for site analysis prior to placing architectural projects in urban and non-urban contexts. Architects need to be aware of the complexities of a site in order to place a structure, understand the impacts of that placement, and to positively contribute to mitigating climate change. This class also teaches a few key skills for understanding a site: first, to understand drawing as a mode of inquiry and as a disciplinary tool to dissect the reality; and two, to develop the \u2018ecological view\u2019 of the reality.ARCH 6212Materials and Methods(3)This course introduces the basic materials, types, and systems of building construction.

Students will gain hands-on experience in working with local collections, particularly the Middle American Research Institute at Tulane, and the New Orleans Museum of Art, and practice designing a virtual exhibition of Maya art of their own, taking into consideration the contemporary praxis and politics around Indigenous arts.ARHS 3750Global Contemporary Art(3)This Art History course examines contemporary art in a global context. We will begin by considering early contemporary art, from the late 1960s and 1970s, focusing on issues, theories, and artworks emerging in selected geographic zones: Latin America, East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, Western Europe, the United States, and Eastern Europe.

What persistent themes, issues, and debates inform the work by African diaspora artist? What makes art \"Black\" (or \"African\" or \"African American\")?  Is an artist of African descent necessarily a \"Black artist\"? Do artist of African descent have a particular obligation to make artwork that advances a black cultural or political agenda?  Is not doing so in and of itself a political statement?  How might a landscape or Abstract Expressionist work be racially charged?  How do vectors of identity other than race inform the work of African diaspora artist?  How does the artwork studied in this course fit into the context of other art histories?  Through these questions and others, this course explores the major themes and issues that have occupied artists of African descent as well as examines individual artists' motivations and intentions.ARHS 3910Special Topics in Art History(3,4)Special topics in the history, criticism, or theory of art.

We will focus particularly on the rise of the mendicant orders in the thirteenth century and their impact on art and the narrative of the Renaissance.ARHS 6310Global Renaissance(3)ARHS 6320Colonialisms in Latin American Art(3-4)According to the conventional geography of art history, \u201ccolonial\u201d art was produced in peripheral spaces, lacking political (and consequently artistic) autonomy. An art history that centered metropolitan and imperial capitals inevitably cast on \u201ccolonial\u201d art as something less than \u2013in quality, in originality\u2014that of these centers. New paradigms, however, have emerged in the wake of critiques of a Euro-centric world order, and the practice of art history shaped by it.\nThis course focuses on recent art historical scholarship and exhibitions, almost all from the past decade, that deals with colonial art and the new paradigms of research and theory being developed for it. While much of the course will deal with colonial Latin America, we will also look to other colonial situations, including British India, Australia, and Ghana. During the last weeks of the course, we will also look at the work of post-colonial contemporary artists, who see themselves as the inheritors and interrogators of colonial legacies.ARHS 6330Prints & Ways of Knowing(3-4)How did the visual arts and sciences interact in the Early Modern period? In what ways have these interactions defined and ruptured boundaries between empirical investigation and artistic practice?  This new seminar on the rise of printmaking c. 1500-1800 investigates print as a new technology and artistic medium. Printmaking allowed for changes not only in art production, but in intellectual inquiry. What new representational techniques emerged? What is the rhetoric of the illustrations themselves? Topics include the study and representation of anatomy, botany, and the celestial spheres in print, and how their artistic representation fundamentally changed our understanding of the natural world. In tandem with these new technologies, optical instruments such as microscopes and telescopes opened previously invisible worlds to scrutiny. We will discuss the intellectual, social worlds such devices and images inhabited.ARHS 6350Landscape Theory (1450\u20131800)(3,4)The ways in which our society figures in relation to the natural environment has never been so urgent. This seminar studies the history of that entanglement through an examination of the significance and meaning of \u201clandscape\u201d in art, literature, architecture, and landscape design. This course studies how conceptions of landscape, evident in physical forms as well as poetic and artistic representations shaped the ideological and natural terrain of Europe from antiquity to the 18th century, with particular emphasis on the period of 1450\u20131800. The course stresses a critical approach to landscape through the analysis of social and cultural context, expressive content and function, style, and theory.ARHS 6375Michelangelo and His Reception(3,4)Within his lifetime Michelangelo Buonarrotti (1475\u20131564) found himself inexplicably hailed as \"Divine\". This seminar investigates the work of this Renaissance titan and the impact of his art production on Renaissance art theory and its aftermath. Topics include his early training, specific uses of media (drawing, painting, sculpture, architecture), major projects (the David, the Sistine Chapel frescoes, the architecture of St. Peter's) case studies of specific competitions and rivalries (Leonardo vs. Michelangelo and Michelangelo vs. Raphael), and themes such as artistic collaboration and the non-finito. The final classes will be devoted to art theory and reception, including Michelangelo\u2019s own writings on art and the legacy of the artist's biography generated by Giorgio Vasari and Condivi, concluding with his 19th-century reception in France.ARHS 6410Amsterdam and the Global Dutch Golden Age(3,4)This course examines the visual and material culture of the Dutch Golden Age, centered in Amsterdam, as the product of global forces.

Rather than solely tracing the domestic consumption of international goods or the ways in which Dutch demands shaped artistic production in Batavia (Indonesia), Brazil, South Asia and North America, this seminar critically examines concepts of influence, exoticism and cross-cultural exchange.  We will focus on objects and art works produced in , imported and exported through Amsterdam.  By investigating the economic realities that enabled the flourishing of Amsterdam as cultural center, this course seeks to complicate readings of seventeenth-century Dutch visual culture (particularly genre scenes and still-lifes) as culturally introspective.ARHS 6420Early Modern Copies(3,4)This course considers the uses, technologies and theories of the early modern copy from the miraculous icon to the forgery, the emulative imitation to the workshop replica, and the pastiche to the reenactment. Copying was a crucial part of artistic pedagogy;  the early modern period is characterized by imitation and emulation of classical art, architecture and literature, but the Renaissance also saw innovative technologies of reproductive art-making and new concerns with how to distinguish good copies from the bad.ARHS 6430Jesuits and the Globe(3,4)This seminar considers the art and architecture commissioned and \nutilized by the Jesuit Order in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as the Society of Jesus embarked upon a  worldwide project of evangelization. With missions and missionaries from Japan to Germany, Goa to Peru, we will \nconsider how this missionary order both adapted to local contexts and attempted to forge a communal identity that stretched across the early modern globe.ARHS 6510Seminars in the History of Art(3)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Course Limit:99ARHS 6511Seminars in the History of Art(3)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Course Limit:99ARHS 6512Seminars in the History of Art(3)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Course Limit:99ARHS 6513Seminars in the History of Art(3)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Course Limit:99ARHS 6514Seminars in the History of Art(3)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Course Limit:99ARHS 6520Seminars in the History of Art(3)Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Course Limit:99ARHS 6525Social Practice Art(3,4)This Art History course examines the history and theory of Social Practice art, a recent mode of artmaking in which artists and art institutions collaborate with individuals and organizations to create community-specific works of art. Classroom readings and discussions will examine forms of Social Practice in relation to histories and theories of participatory, political, and activist art since the 1960s. This course includes a 20 hour service learning component with Prospect New Orleans, a citywide triennial of contemporary art with the social mission of connecting high art to the larger cultural landscape of New Orleans through community-specific works.ARHS 6530Degas(3)In-depth examination of Degas' works and career in light of various historical and critical approaches, ranging from formalism and iconography to sociopolitical and cultural studies, Marxism, psychoanalysis, and feminism. Attention will be paid to male and female spectatorship and to relevant works by Degas' Impressionist contemporaries, including Cassatt, Gonzales, Manet, Morisot, and Whistler, as well as other artists including Daumier, Delacroix, Ingres, Tissot, and Toulouse-Lautrec. Additional comparative topics include academic art, photography, journalistic illustration, and Japanese prints.ARHS 6540Paris: Capital of the Nineteenth Century(3,4)This seminar explores the transformation of Paris during the second half of the nineteenth century into a great modern metropolis.", "start_char_idx": 29861, "end_char_idx": 34320, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c431f73-edfa-46d8-8805-6f396a0669d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c431f73-edfa-46d8-8805-6f396a0669d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Art.txt", "file_name": "Art.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47811, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d09ce67e-dde6-469a-b1e5-fd9b4dafd294", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Art.txt", "file_name": "Art.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47811, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "78e6956c2194d1d2010931bb8597a38e0fdd5d7fc5de445aa4a54f0f3b0b3a58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a271ef2-4410-4cad-bcb0-eb5a32575a27", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Art.txt", "file_name": "Art.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47811, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "a9336f1cd70940b120344dfe818bb6f4c31337d8c92d34409ef99ae107b459bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a49ac26-51de-4b36-b173-c1eef95a168e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "49504203f747293f60ce39ef159aee887e17367dfb962afc3e6f6ee78a4ad35a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Attention will be paid to male and female spectatorship and to relevant works by Degas' Impressionist contemporaries, including Cassatt, Gonzales, Manet, Morisot, and Whistler, as well as other artists including Daumier, Delacroix, Ingres, Tissot, and Toulouse-Lautrec.

Throughout the course we analyze the ways that the architecture, painting, photography, literature, and visual culture of the era shaped and reflected various facets of this modern city.ARHS 6550Van Gogh(3)ARHS 6620Reading Abstract Expressionism(3,4)Examines the ways in which Abstract Expressionism has been interpreted, both from the view of American critics and historians and their European counterparts. Emphasizes the extent to which formalist criticism evolved around Abstract Expressionism, and that only recently have scholars challenged those apolitical reading of this art, considering the political and economic factors which contributed to its international predominance on the global stage. Artists will include De Kooning, Frankenthaler, Hofmann, Krasner, Newman, Pollock, and Still.ARHS 6640Rauschenberg, Johns & Early Warhol(3-4)Artists Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns are credited with expanding the field of visual art at mid-century in terms of content and media. As members of the Neo-Dada group, alongside composer John Cage and choreographer Merce Cunningham, they charted a course out of abstract expressionism that pointed away from painting as an exclusive artistic practice, and toward a reinvigoration of subject matter that culminated in pop art. Johns and Rauschenberg were both intimate partners and business partners, and their commercial design-work often brought them into partnership with Andy Warhol, who would make his mark as a pop artist a few years later. Rauschenberg, Johns and Warhol were queer men who negotiated their sexualities in different ways during the McCarthy era when homosexuality in New York city was a crime. This seminar will examine the development of each artist\u2019s work within the context of postwar American art and criticism while charting the strategies and codes each artist employed\u2014even the persona\u2019s they adopted, whether it be Jasper Johns, the \u201cOrganization Man,\u201d or Andy Warhol, the \u201cCool Cat\u201d\u2014to locate discursive \nspace in the conformist culture of the 1950\u2019s.ARHS 6650Postmodern Formations: Art Since 1980(3)Examines both European and American conceptions of postmodernism, as it originated in post-structural and psychoanalytic theory. Emphasis will be place upon artists working since 1980, including Basquiat, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Mapplethorpe, Cindy Sherman, Warhol and the politically based art project of Gran Fury, the Guerrilla Girls and the Names Project. Interpretive strategies will be taken from readings in European literary theory, with emphasis place upon the shift in criticism in art-making, away from Europe, toward an ideology formed around the issues of racial, sexual, and gender performance of identity.ARHS 6660Art Acquisitions, Collect Mgmt(3)This course will examine art industry best practices for the acquisition of art objects for institutional, investment and private uses, as well as explore the central issues for collection management. We will explore art industry platforms for art acquisition: galleries, art fairs, auctions (brick & mortars. online), and private dealers. The course will stress methods for due diligence in acquisitions including research on provenance, authenticity, and research strategies for identifying stolen or forged objects.We will examine how monetary value is determined across art industries, from the retail gallery to the insurance company. Writing assignments will focus upon research methods for art objects and antiques, incorporating strategies of collection management such as condition, conservation, and best practices for art storage and maintenance.ARHS 6810Seminars in the History of Art(3,4)Advanced topics in the history, criticism, or theory of art.

Concentrating primarily on the 18th and 191h centuries (but with some temporal projection in both directions to consider both precursors and postcolonial reverberations) and exploring examples from the British. Spanish. and French empires. we _will consider a diverse array of material\u00ad drawings, paintings, prints. sculpture, decorative arts. fashion, museum display, private collections, photography and film-in order to think about the ways that visual and material culture informed colonial identities and supported imperial enterprise and also could be used to resist them. Students are encouraged to offer perspectives and bring in supplemental material that expands the scope of the course dialogue and to pursue their own particular interests related to the concerns of the course in their final papers/projects (included exploring different time periods or colonial empires). Finally, while race will be the primary vector of identity explored. its inevitable intersections with gender, class, and sexuality will necessarily receive attention.ARHS 6875Race and National Mythologies in American Art and Visual Culture(3,4)How does American art and visual culture implicitly and explicitly reify notions of America as a \"white\" nation, and how has this changed over time?  How have images shaped and been shaped by historic moments of racially-implicated upheaval or conflict (e.g. Westward Expansion; the abolition movement, the Civil War and Emancipation; periods of mass immigration)?  How has the idea of what it means to be \"American\" been defined against the racialized images of American \"Others\"?  Can contemporary artists of color successfully appropriate and re-deploy racist imagery?  This seminar considers these and other questions in investigating constructions and representations in American art and visual culture from the 16th century to the present.

The neuroscience of ethics deals with our growing understanding of the underlying mechanism of social behavior relevant to morality \u2013 for instance, the origins and nature of empathy, altruism, aggression, self-control, reasoning, and the role of our emotions and intuitions in moral decision making. The ethics of neuroscience is a branch of applied ethics or bioethics. It focuses on ethical issues that originate in new advances and possibilities in neuroscience. Especially relevant here is the fact that advances in neuroscience not only extend our understanding of the brain, but also raise the possibility of interventions to modify our brain. This course is designed to give students a philosophical overview of these topics, and opportunities to think critically about ethical implications related to neuroscience and advances in medicine. We will explore fundamental topics in both branches of Neuroethics. Drawing from a variety of fields\u2014neuroscience, philosophy, social psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and evolutionary theory\u2014we will investigate and discuss questions like: What are the evolutionary origins of moral judgment? Does evolutionary theory shed light on normative moral questions? Do our moral motivations derive from reason or pre-reflective intuition? Do psychopaths have moral responsibility? Do we have free will? Is there an obligation to enhance ourselves? Should drugs be used to enhance mental functioning? Prerequisite(s):PHIL\u00a01030,3050,3510,3550,3580or6050.

It then turns to discussion of the various ethical frameworks that guide decision-making in medicine. Finally, it closes by bringing these frameworks to bear on theoretical issues relating to social justice.BEMH 4003Medical Humanities(3)Medical humanities draws on many disciplines and fields\u2014including history, literature, art history, media studies, philosophy, law, ethics, religion, theology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and other arts and sciences\u2014to study the context of medicine, the experience of medicine, the goals of medicine, and concepts in and of medicine. A common goal of medical humanities is to make clinicians, at all levels of their training, more \u201chumane\u201d or \u201ccompassionate.\u201d Another common goal includes making clinicians more \u201cwell-rounded.\u201d Still another goal includes promoting teaching and learning in medical humanities simply for its own sake.  But what is \u201cmedical humanities\u201d? While there is no single answer to this question, this much is clear: Medical humanities draws from many disciplines and fields to examine issues related to the development and the practice of medicine. In this sense, medical humanities is similar to other fields such as religious studies or gender studies\u2014fields that use various disciplines and methods to study a subject such as religion or gender. What is different, however, is that medical humanities, unlike many other academic fields, seems to require or to imply an essential practical component because all medical humanities knowledge has some relationship to (1) the care of patients and/or populations or (2) the care of physicians themselves. This course will explore a vast array of topics in medical humanities, including the boundaries and the goals of medicine (philosophy); the relationship between narrative and medicine (literature); contemporary health issues (policy); human rights and human rights abuses (ethics); and death and dying (religion).  It is my hope that we will come away with an increased understanding of ourselves and our relation to the world of medicine\u2014that, in other words, we will examine our own lives, learning how to love and to work with all the fullness that life affords.BEMH 4004Environmental Ethics(3)This course examines the theoretical foundations, assumptions, and practical implications of environmental ethics.

This course will familiarize learners with the basic modes and styles of ethics consultation in clinical settings. Learners will also study policy development and educational aspects of hospital ethics committees. Participants will apply philosophical and sociological concepts to cases and policy in clinical settings, will consider methods of mediation, as well as the arguments regarding certification in clinical consultation. Clinical ethics topics of particular emphasis will include informed consent, refusal of treatment, reproductive health, and end-of-life issues.BEMH 4012The End of Life in Film & Lit.(3)This course examines representations of dying and death in literature and film. The focus of the course will be on discussing and analyzing these representations for the purpose of gaining a richer understanding of lived experiences of health, illness, and death. Topics to be discussed include the following: illness and suffering, definitions of health, politics of suffering and death, definitions of death, narratives of death and dying.BEMH 4013Medicine and Identity(3)After a one-week introduction, the course will cover three modules\u2014Race (weeks 2-5), Gender (weeks 6-9), and Ability (weeks 10-13)\u2014followed by a final project in week 14. Each module will contain four parts: (1) Historical Context and Framing; (2) First-person and third-person perspectives; (3) Fiction and nonfiction; and (4) Contemporary voicesBEMH 4014Pandemic Ethics(3)This course is split into three Units. Unit I discusses issues relating to the duty of physicians to care for patients during times of pandemic. Are physicians obligated to care for patients with highly infectious disease? How much personal risks are physicians morally required to take on? In Unit II students will consider questions relating to the just distribution of scarce resources in the context of pandemic medicine. How can we ethically decide which patients will receive life-sustaining resources and which will not? Should younger patients receive higher priority than older patients? How should we go about distributing vaccines or other preventive measures throughout the general population? Finally, Unit III focuses on problems relating to social justice in times of pandemic. How do we ensure that the burdens of a pandemic are equitably distributed between social groups? How far may the government go in constraining individual rights for the sake of public health? How should we understand the obligations of the average citizen to promote the public good? The overall goal of the course will be to help students think carefully and constructively about the ethical issues raised by the current public health crisis.BEMH 4015Pro-Natalism, Anti-Natalism and the Ethics of Human Reproduction(3)This course will explore in-depth the ethical and philosophical issues arising from views that encourage procreation and those that claim that procreation is morally bad, and the practice of artificial reproductive services and technologies. We will investigate and discuss questions such as: Is there a duty to have children? Do we cause harm by having children? Can it be wrong to reproduce? Is it better never to have come into existence? Is abortion morally permissible? Do pregnant women have a duty to aid the fetus by allowing it the use of their body? Is there a moral difference between killing someone and letting her die? Is it wrong to reproduce through cloning? With the assistance of surrogate mothers and donated eggs? Should we avoid having children with disabilities? Should we use genetic screening or genetic engineering to have the \u201cbest\u201d kids we possibly can? Is it wrong to have a child if there are known genetic risk factors? Should parents be permitted to select for disability?

It considers problems relating to the nature of health and illness, the basis of medical knowledge, the nature of the physician/patient relationship, and more.BEMH 6001Neuroethics: The Ethics of Neuroscience and the Neuroscience of Ethics(3)Neuroethics, as an area of study, can be divided into two sub-fields: the neuroscience of ethics and the ethics of neuroscience (Roskies 2002). The\nneuroscience of ethics deals with our growing understanding of the underlying mechanism of social behavior relevant to morality \u2013 for instance, the\norigins and nature of empathy, altruism, aggression, self-control, reasoning, and the role of our emotions and intuitions in moral decision making. The\nethics of neuroscience is a branch of applied ethics or bioethics. It focuses on ethical issues that originate in new advances and possibilities in\nneuroscience. Especially relevant here is the fact that advances in neuroscience not only extend our understanding of the brain, but also raise the\npossibility of interventions to modify our brain. This course is designed to give students a philosophical overview of these topics, and opportunities to think critically about ethical implications related to neuroscience and advances in medicine. We will explore fundamental topics in both branches of Neuroethics. Drawing from a variety of fields\u2014neuroscience, philosophy, social psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and evolutionary theory\u2014we will investigate and discuss questions like: What are the evolutionary origins of moral judgment? Does evolutionary theory shed light on normative moral questions? Do our moral motivations derive from reason or pre-reflective intuition? Do psychopaths have moral responsibility? Do we have free will? Is there an obligation to enhance ourselves? Should drugs be used to enhance mental functioning?BEMH 6002Foundations in Bioethics(3)This course examines the theoretical foundations of bioethics. It begins by considering foundational questions regarding the nature of medicine, illness, and the physician/patient relationship. It then turns to discussion of the various ethical frameworks that guide decision-making in medicine. Finally, it closes by bringing these frameworks to bear on theoretical issues relating to social justice.BEMH 6003Medical Humanities(3)Medical humanities draws on many disciplines and fields\u2014including history, literature, art history, media studies, philosophy, law, ethics, religion, theology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and other arts and sciences\u2014to study the context of medicine, the experience of medicine, the goals of medicine, and concepts in and of medicine.

Unit I discusses issues relating to the duty of physicians to care for patients during times of pandemic. Are physicians obligated to care for patients with highly infectious disease? How much personal risks are physicians morally required to take on? In Unit II students will consider questions relating to the just distribution of scarce resources in the context of pandemic medicine. How can we ethically decide which patients will receive life-sustaining resources and which will not? Should younger patients receive higher priority than older patients? How should we go about distributing vaccines or other preventive measures throughout the general population? Finally, Unit III focuses on problems relating to social justice in times of pandemic. How do we ensure that the burdens of a pandemic are equitably distributed between social groups? How far may the government go in constraining individual rights for the sake of public health? How should we understand the obligations of the average citizen to promote the public good? The overall goal of the course will be to help students think carefully and constructively about the ethical issues raised by the current public health crisis.BEMH 6015Pro-Natalism, Anti-Natalism and the Ethics of Human Reproduction(3)This course will explore in-depth the ethical and philosophical issues arising from views that encourage procreation and those that claim that procreation is morally bad, and the practice of artificial reproductive services and technologies.

While learning about major historical events, we will also explore various aspects of Roman cultural and social history. Topics for discussion include politics, social status, gender roles, religion, warfare, murder and conspiracy, and ancient spectacle. No prerequisites. (Note: Not open to senior history majors)CLAS 1030The Greeks(3)This course offers an introduction to the literature, history, culture, art and architecture of the ancient Greeks. Focusing on Greeks living throughout the Mediterranean from the Bronze Age down to the Hellenistic Period, the course is organized around targeted investigations that explore important aspects of ancient Greek civilization such as colonial expansion, the invention of alphabetic writing, the birth of drama, etc. The aim of the course is not to be exhaustive, but rather to introduce students to the study of antiquity. We will regularly delve into scholarly debate, consider what kinds of evidence underlie our knowledge, and examine the limits of interpretation all while developing our familiarity with the ancient Greeks.CLAS 1040Mythology(3)This course will introduce you to the gods, heroes, and monsters of Greek and Roman mythology. The focus of the course involves reading and discussing selected works of ancient Greek and Roman literature in English translation, but we will also move beyond these narratives to examine how the Greeks and Romans portrayed their myths in other media, including art and architecture.CLAS 1050The Romans(3)The Romans focuses on the social and cultural history of the ancient Roman world. We will examine Roman identity, institutions, society, technology, architecture, religion, and other aspects of Roman life using a variety of Roman texts alongside examples of material culture (i.e., archaeological objects, architecture, and art).

It provides an introduction to the methodology and theory of archaeology and an overview of the material cultures of the complex societies that inhabited the region.  Special attention will be paid to cultures of the Israelites, Phoenicians, Philistines, and Arabs and the impact of external imperial rule (from the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians to the Greeks and Romans) on the life and culture of these socieites.  We will also investigate the transformation of the region from the rise of Christianity and the Muslim conquest through emergence of Israel as a modern nation-state.  Throughout we will focus on extant texts, inscriptions, material culture such as pottery, figurines, and sculpture, and public, religious, and domestic architecture to reconstruct a detailed picture of this region as a dynamic crossroads of civilizations.CLAS 2220New Testament Historical Intro(3)This course is a literary and historical introduction to the canonical New Testament.

And how can we know about the religious experience of a population that is long gone? Both these questions are interconnected and represent the core of this course. Week after week, we will reconstruct the principles and articulation of religious beliefs and practice in ancient Greece, reflecting on the evidence we can use. We will discover the ways that religious system mirrors a specific understanding of human society and its place in the universe. And, with it, we will find that, surprisingly or not, that religious system provided a solid base to several modern religious practices.CLAS 2330Alexander the Great(3)Alexander the Great (356-323) is justifiably one of the most celebrated figures of antiquity. Conquering all of the Greek world and Asia from the Mediterranean to the Indus River in Pakistan by the age of 30, he unquestionably changed the world, bringing Greeks, Macedonians, Persians, Egyptians and Jews into close contact and exchange.  But who was the historical Alexander?  Was he a charismatic strategist, a genius and visionary?  Or a paranoid, alcoholic, and violent megalomaniac who brought about the end of his dynasty and left his empire, and much of the world, in chaos?  Many wrote about his life in exploits, but the problematic nature if the ancient sources presents serious difficulties in reconstructing an account of the 'historical' Alexander.  We will explore various genres (history, fiction, myth, biography) and sources (literary, visual, archaeological) to analyze critically the sources and uses of Alexander in various periods and places of history.CLAS 2340Troy: Beyond the Myth(3)The Trogan War: famous heroes against each other, astute decoys, tragic deaths, plotting, intrigue, and the gods in the midst of it.  Was it all fiction?  In this class, we will use literary and archaeological evidence to answer this question.CLAS 2390Semester Abroad(1-20)For transfer of credit. Department approval required.

Topics include medicine in mythology, theories of medicine, pharmacology, military medicine, medical tools, women's health, and physicians in society. Students will not only gain a knowledge of the foundation of medicine, but also better understand the practice of medicine as it exists today through guest lectures and a field trip to the Pharmacy Museum in the French Quarter.CLAS 2410Race: Antiquity to U.S.(3)This course will examine cultural constructions of race, moving between the ancient Mediterranean to the modern United States. Together, we will explore literary and artistic evidence to understand how the Greeks and Romans conceptualized the world and the humans within it. As we will see, ancient thinkers found numerous ways to explain human variety, none of which correspond precisely to modern notions of race. Flowing forwards and backwards in time, we will investigate how the authors of America\u2019s racial caste system pressed Greece and Rome into the service of contemporary power \nstructures, reimagining them as ancestors of White America. Additionally, we will study Black Americans\u2014enslaved and free\u2014who have pushed against this reconstruction, reclaiming the ancient Mediterranean as their own.CLAS 2600The Classical World in Film(3)This interdisciplinary course investigates the use of themes from classical history, literature, and mythology in modern cinematography.

Reading assignments will include selections from Greek and Roman, such as epic, tragedy, history, lyric poetry, philosophy, and novel. The readings will be flanked by a selection of movies and clips that show modern adaptations of the same theme discussed in the readings.CLAS 2610Sex and Gender in Antiquity(3)This course explores a wide range of topics related to sexuality and gender in the ancient Mediterranean. Using ancient literary sources, inscriptions, artwork, and modern scholarship, we will try to reconstruct Greek and Roman attitudes about sexuality and gender at different places and different times. In particular, we will focus on the depiction of female leadership in ancient literature, and will consider the following questions: How do the male writers of antiquity describe female leaders? Do they display the same attributes of leadership as their male counterparts, or is there something distinctly feminine about their mode of leadership? Are women depicted in leaders in various spheres of activity (battle, home, politics, etc.)? Is there always a sense of transgression or inferiority associated with female leadership? Do literary depictions match the primary evidence that documents the roles of women in their communities? How can these ancient texts inform the current debates about women in leadership roles?CLAS 2810Special Topics(3)Special topics in Classical Studies focused on particular areas and issues in the fields of ancient culture, religion, history, and/or archaeology.

Instead, his legacy has been shaped by the accounts of others - former students, bemused comedians, admirers and even a few detractors. In this course, we will examine the many faces of Socrates bequeathed to us by his contemporaries, investigate the world of 5th century Athens in which he lived, and survey important moments in his posthumous reception.CLAS 3090Law & Society In Ancient Rome(3)In this course we will focus on the law of the Roman family, covering such topics as personal status, marriage, divorce, and inheritance, as well as the situation of women and children within the Roman family.CLAS 3120Etruscans & Early Rome(3)From the Late Bronze Age until their assimilation into the Roman world, the Etruscans were building cities, decorating tombs, and establishing trade networks at home and abroad. While their literature and written history are lost, their extensive material culture survives. In this course, students will learn how to examine a culture known primarily from its artifacts and discover how it influenced early Rome.CLAS 3140Jews in the Greco-Roman World(3)This course will explore Jewish interaction and conflict with Greeks and Romans from the Babylonian exile through the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem.  We will examine the rich body of literature and material culture from this period to reconstruct the Jewish experience in both Palestine and the Diaspora communities in Egypt, Asia Minor, and Rome.  The course will consider texts written by Jews as well as Greeks and Romans, representing both sides of this exchange, and archaeological evidence that sheds light on daily life in the period.  Topics will include:  the Maccabean Revolt, the Hasmonean dynasty, Herod the Great, the Alexandrian riots of 38 CE, Jewish religion and sectarianism, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Jewish Revolts. Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99CLAS 3160The Aegean Bronze Age(3)The civilizations that populated the Aegean during the Bronze Age were later remembered in mythology, fabulous tales, and epic poetry. Homer sang about the cultural wealth of those earlier kingdoms, from Crete to Mainland Greece. This course offers you the chance to explore their rich and varied archaeological remains. From the majestic palaces to the elaborate frescoes, the decorated pottery, the administrative records, and other material evidence, we will reconstruct the life and activities of the populations of the Aegean from the beginning to the end of the Bronze Age. In our journey, we will also stop and discuss the archaeological methodologies and the current topics of investigation on the Aegean Bronze Age.CLAS 3170Greek Art & Archaeology(3)In this course, we will explore the archaeological remains and the development and use of specific artistic trends of the ancient Greek culture. Human inhabitation of Greece left the remains of a rich and complex society, with grandiose public architecture, elaborate vase painting, and a legacy that still lives on. Working together as a class, we will explore how to use these material remains to find the Greeks, interpret their lives, and understand their choices and the impact they had on their culture. By studying a variety of archaeological remains, from pottery to art and architecture, we will bring the Greeks back to life, in class, with us! We will cover aspects of Greek political organization, trade and contact with other civilizations in the ancient Mediterranean, funerary habits. At the same time, we will be discussing about our modern approach to the study of the Greeks, focusing on the use of art and archaeology in politics and propaganda, current problems and controversies in Greek archaeology, archaeological methods, and issues of archaeological ethics.CLAS 3180Roman Art & Archaeology(3)The Roman Empire encompassed the entire rim of the Mediterranean Sea and much of western Europe.

This course will undertake an intensive analysis of the material culture of ancient Rome through its art and archaeology. In successfully completing the semester, you will gain a thorough knowledge of the art and archaeology of ancient Rome and its world, focusing especially on changes through time and on the political, social, and economic developments that are illuminated by material remains. We will also discuss current issues related to Roman antiquities and the preservation of world cultural heritage. Working together as a class, we will learn how to use the archaeological record to reconstruct the past, while at the same time examining our own culture and its role in human history.CLAS 3190Pompeii:Life in a Roman Town(3)The Roman city of Pompeii, utterly destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 C.E., has captured the world\u2019s imagination for nearly three centuries. This semester, we will examine the material remains of Pompeii, analyzing how evidence as diverse as standing architecture, monumental inscriptions, portable and permanent art, and even garbage and graffiti can be used to reconstruct ancient lives.  Working together as a class, we will investigate the development of Pompeian studies from the earliest systematic excavations of the 1750s to current projects utilizing groundbreaking technologies, and propose new directions for future research in a city that has many more secrets to reveal.CLAS 3230Ancient Christianity(3)In this course we examine the development of Christianity in the Roman Empire during the first four centuries CE.  We will consider both the development of the Church from its beginnings as a religious movement to its becoming one of the dominant institutions in the Roman Empire. We will investigate how the Church gained converts, how it was structured, the relationship between orthodox Christianity and \u2018heresies,\u2019 the Church's conflicts with the Roman Empire, and the changes in the Church resulting from the conversion of Constantine in the early fourth century.CLAS 3320Death and Dying from Greece to Rome(3)Death is a universal human experience. Cutting across time, culture, gender, age, and any other division humans might create between ourselves, it affects everyone on earth. Studying death, however, does not have to be morbid; indeed, the evidence for individual and cultural reactions to death has been created entirely by the living. In examining death, therefore, we find an excellent path of inquiry into life. In this course, we will analyze Greek and Roman experiences of death in order to better understand ancient lives. Topics will range widely, with time given to both the literary and material evidence, learning how the two come together to illuminate ancient life. Furthermore, we will consider our contemporary notions of death, particularly its unique role in the culture of New Orleans.CLAS 3510The Ancient Novel(4)We are all familiar today with the literary form called the novel: a lengthy fictional narrative in prose. It was ancient Greek and Latin authors, however, who first created this form. Many of these works survive and they always intrigue and delight readers with their highly sophisticated plotting of love affairs, comical depictions of pirates, and teasing explorations of sexuality. We will closely read, in English translation, the major ancient novels and some of their literary predecessors in order to understand the originality of the form and content of the novels. The class concludes with a consideration of the ancient novel's contribution to the development of fiction in the West.CLAS 3810Special Topics(3)Special topics in Classical Studies focused on particular areas and issues in the fields of ancient culture, religion, history, and/or archaeology.", "start_char_idx": 14853, "end_char_idx": 19527, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "915e3ad5-3152-4e86-8223-913d645bba1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "915e3ad5-3152-4e86-8223-913d645bba1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Classics.txt", "file_name": "Classics.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34661, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "867f15a6-956e-4ffe-b709-3c4b940c69c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Classics.txt", "file_name": "Classics.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34661, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "b0b2deddd1e310eba7f66429ae73524fdb257d1628d624ff67b115216a61a753", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae822220-f294-42fb-830d-69f93747c571", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Classics.txt", "file_name": "Classics.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34661, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "cb4af2f49fc35df717c773464124e6f50b92908b4ca5cae77777bc69ec677dd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a0cfcd3-79f6-404f-8114-1f5fdb5ce6d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae8c7bf7d794425cccb844e0e55b11938f6cb7b965d91c23a158d3998c9c7f74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Furthermore, we will consider our contemporary notions of death, particularly its unique role in the culture of New Orleans.CLAS 3510The Ancient Novel(4)We are all familiar today with the literary form called the novel: a lengthy fictional narrative in prose.

The shift to digital cinema has encouraged historians and theorists to revise distinctions between animation and film and to reckon with the pervasiveness of moving image media created through diverse techniques. To understand the implications of this shift and the significance of animation within media history, this course analyzes animation genres, techniques, and styles and investigates theories of animation as they developed from the late 19th century up to the present.COMM 3600Documentary Film(3)The films to be studied in this course are selected from the spectrum of documentary film practice from the 1920s to the present. Concentration will be on specific topics as well as an historical overview. Consideration placed on the developing and shifting conception of documentary film practice, social issues, political and propagandistic values, and documenting other.COMM 3610Alternative Journalism(3,4)This course balances the practical development of literary journalistic skills with academic inquiry into the theorizing and development of journal ism that conceptualized itself as an alternative to mainstream news content, media and\npractices. It will also examine the changing meaning of the word alternative\" in\nrelation to journalistic genres.COMM 3620Digital Civic Engagement(1-3)Digital Civic Engagement is a course that studies, analyzes, and teaches how citizens engage communities online to improve public knowledge and civic dialogue. The connectivity created by digital platforms to foster citizen engagement is one of the most important and distinctive organizing features of contemporary political life. Dispersed knowledge and community engagement helps define and deconstruct boundaries of the social and political community while redefining, and at times erasing, divisions that are founded on inequity and exclusion. Given largely asynchronously with synchronous check-ins, students choose how they apply this knowledge by serving a digital nonprofit through one of five service projects: content creation, content curation, media archiving, development/fundraising, online research.COMM 3650Feminist Doc & New Media(3)A service-learning, praxis-oriented course in which students develop analytical and reflective skills by critiquing and creating feminist documentation in various media. Study of history and theory of feminist documentary filmmaking and new media will be complemented with learning production and post\u00adproduction skills. Weekly volunteer work will be done with an organization serving women and girls in New Orleans.COMM 3700Digital Archives & Cult Memory(3)This course combines theory and methods in the study of media archives, cultural memory, and historiography. This course works with community partners to create digital stories and their archival repositories.COMM 3720Disability Media Studies(3)In this class, we will explore the relationship between disability and media.  Our analyses will span film, television, advertisement, new media, social media, media technologies, and other cultural mediums across history and into the present.  The beginning of the course will introduce students to the field of disability studies and its relevance to media studies.  Through an interdisciplinary lens, students will consider how people with disabilities were and are represented in the media with particular attention to how disability intersects with gender, race, sexuality, and class identity.  Beyond themes of representation, our course deeply interrogates disability media access.  We will consider how people with disabilities have responded to inaccurate and inaccessible media and innovatively used media outlets to represent themselves and produce culture on their own terms.COMM 3730Race, Nature, and Disaster(3)This interdisciplinary course examines the intersections of race, politics, and environmental and biological disaster. We will look at how ideas about race in the U.S. have shaped and been shaped by social policy, global politics and economics, and U.S. foreign policy, and investigate how certain populations within and outside the U.S. become disproportionately vulnerable to wide-scale disaster. Readings and discussions focus on the human-made dimensions of biological disasters, such as typhus, the bubonic plague, HIV/AIDS, the cholera outbreak in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, and the current COVID-19 crisis. \nIn thinking about how vulnerability is created and maintained according to a racial logic, we will interrogate the following questions:  How is the construct of \u201cnature\u201d framed in opposition to \u201chumanity\u201d?", "start_char_idx": 24431, "end_char_idx": 29701, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed3db7ec-d443-482c-a1d4-0b8881b234ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed3db7ec-d443-482c-a1d4-0b8881b234ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Communication.txt", "file_name": "Communication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60051, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90da40b1-e9f5-47e1-a360-4999a959208e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Communication.txt", "file_name": "Communication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60051, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "d471c37bc3f8a84dc6cdf0360b58c5eaea51cc32eef306e1736ec53272e79190", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3f4f92d-055b-464d-860d-f442d58b2baa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Communication.txt", "file_name": "Communication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60051, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "35ceb0bc1011c3c55c8cc0b3e5c38920faa6f3ea26280dfc5da43e279431332b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29502fa4-c98c-4cf4-9e4e-76dfcf70ff8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ea40f7c8f78af84451a7971e3f6c8e9ccd1f46e6df9f97b05e07db6fe36bf8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We will look at how ideas about race in the U.S. have shaped and been shaped by social policy, global politics and economics, and U.S. foreign policy, and investigate how certain populations within and outside the U.S. become disproportionately vulnerable to wide-scale disaster.

How do claims to objective knowledge about nature operate in political realms? In what ways has the nature/humanity binary informed the construction of racial categories and racism? How do ideas of nature serve to obscure the complex intersections of environmental \nand social factors in our daily realities? How do discussions of crisis and disaster (in other words, exceptional situations) serve to authorize extreme measures? How do certain versions of international humanitarianism deny the global interconnectedness of nation-states and the culpability of those giving aid in the dire circumstances of those receiving it?COMM 3750Digital Cinema(3,4)This course introduces students to the history of digital cinema and examines the cultural and political implications of our evolving digital media environment. The transition to the everyday use of digital technologies has been theorized as remediating, relocating, and converging earlier media forms. This course explores the place of film history and theory in this transition and it considers whether this transition marks the end of cinema.COMM 3800Cine Reception & Cult Memory(3)This course investigates historical changes in film audiences, film exhibition and film reception from the silent to the contemporary period as well as the issue of cultural memory and cinema. Issues focusing on who the audience for cinema has been during different historical periods, that changes have taken place in the venues in which films have been shown and cinema reception as cultural history are explored. The course also theorizes questions of reception and memory in terms of psychoanalysis, oral history and the public sphere. This course includes an optional service learning component.COMM\u00a03150, Film Analysis, is recommended but not required.COMM 3810Special Topics(1-4)Special Topics in Communication.

This course will trace the vibrant, ongoing tradition of black internationalism, focusing on its often utopian undercurrents\u2014in particular, its frequent crossing of racial and sexual hierarchies. In so doing, this course will address the relationship between internationalism as a unifying movement of resistance and nationally enforced oppressions; between a solidarity of what Richard Wright termed \u201cscattered but kindred spirits\u201d and enfranchisementat home.  Our course will investigate black internationalism as a diverse appropriation of socialist thought as developed by key theorists and activists of the African Diaspora.COMM 4150Contemporary Hollywood Cinema(3)This course focuses on three key aspects of contemporary Hollywood cinema, namely, the film industry, film form and style, and the production, distribution, and reception of films in the digital age. Key topics include conglomeratization of the film industry, the blockbuster film, films as a franchises, the rise of independent cinema, and independent films, digital distribution, the role of film festivals, and \u00b7pop-up cinema. The course concludes with how the film experience is changing in the era of digital distribution and multiple screens.COMM 4160Contemporary Chinese Cinema(3)This course offers a survey of Chinese-language films made from mid-1980s to early 2000s. The class will focus on three aspects of contemporary Chinese cinema: its artistic features, historical context, and socio-political implications and tackle the following questions: What is a Chinese\" cinema? How do contemporary Chinese filmmakers inheritCOMM 4170U.S. Film History(3,4)This course covers major formal, industrial and cultural issues in the history of cinema in the United States from 1895 to the present Course topics include the formal distinctiveness of the early period, the emergence of continuity editing and the classical Hollywood style, post-classical cinema. Monopolistic industry practices, exhibition venues, the studio system, synchronized sound. Contemporary independent production, and the relationship between film and commodity culture. Case studies on censorship, the representation of race and black radical politics, and female spectatorship integrate formal, industrial and cultural analysis.COMM 4180African Cinema(3)This course will provide a critical and interdisciplinary look at the development of African cinema from its inception in the 1960s to the present.", "start_char_idx": 33105, "end_char_idx": 37930, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "060a20e2-83f0-430a-9715-e2fe7d64b6c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "060a20e2-83f0-430a-9715-e2fe7d64b6c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Communication.txt", "file_name": "Communication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60051, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90da40b1-e9f5-47e1-a360-4999a959208e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Communication.txt", "file_name": "Communication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60051, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "d471c37bc3f8a84dc6cdf0360b58c5eaea51cc32eef306e1736ec53272e79190", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "29502fa4-c98c-4cf4-9e4e-76dfcf70ff8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Communication.txt", "file_name": "Communication.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60051, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "4c7d3db7ff8cd0ccb8360db531903103f6a836e5592c7c284ff01ea6c57934fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae2fcf4a-184c-4120-968e-7b289d948ad1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98d010ad59d9639d2027b9ccb509821cfaf3f106c6932a15c61725f6c11fae6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "How do contemporary Chinese filmmakers inheritCOMM 4170U.S. Film History(3,4)This course covers major formal, industrial and cultural issues in the history of cinema in the United States from 1895 to the present Course topics include the formal distinctiveness of the early period, the emergence of continuity editing and the classical Hollywood style, post-classical cinema.

In looking at this period, we will move from the sociopolitical upheavals of late colonialism to the recent phase of introspection and diversification. The relationship of cinematic practices to transformation in the social and economic sphere will be examined, as well as the creation of distinctively African film styles based on oral traditions. In pursuing these topics, we will consider the impact of technology, history and culture, ties to the cinema of other developing nations and co-productions.COMM 4190Intro to Latin American Film(3)The development of cinema in Latin American from its arrival as an imported technology to the present. Films studied in relation to the sociopolitical environment and emphasis placed on close analysis as well as a contextual understanding of the material. Topics include the struggle to create national Film industries, the art film and New Cinema movements, and recent trends in countries such as Mexico and Argentina.COMM 4200Media Literacy/Media Educ II(3)This is the second semester of a two-semester course that introduces students to media literacy--what it is, media education, and basic media pedagogy. In the second semester, students put to use the media literacy knowledge gained in the first semester by applying those pedagogical considerations in the classroom, assessing student outcomes, and effectively teaching media literacy concepts.\nPrerequisite(s): COMM 3200.Prerequisite(s):COMM 3200.COMM 4261Feminism, Sci-Fi & Technology(3,4)This course considers how contemporary science fiction, new technologies and critical writings about feminism, gender, identity and the body interconnect. Topics under consideration include differently gendered worlds, horror, alien invasions, parasitical relationships, cyborg embodiment, and the gendering of computer and Internet settings.COMM 4262Dangerous Women: Communication, Culture & Body(3,4)An investigation of how human bodies communicate cultural identities and relations historically and across spaces. May repeat under a different topic. May repeat under a different topic (COMM 4260,4261) for credit.COMM 4270SciFi, Sex and Race(3)While science fiction forces us to see what is familiar in new and surprising ways, imagining the unfamiliar also builds upon the familiar. This makes sci-fi a good \u2018venue\u2019 to study the widespread assumptions about human nature in different settings. This course interrogates how we negotiate these basic human categories through various science fiction films and theoretical essays. Reflection on these topics will hopefully provoke fascinating and difficult philosophical questions about the nature of reality, the limits of human knowledge, the notions of personal (racial, ethnic, sexual) identity, and the nature and foundations of universality of these categories.COMM 4280Race, Ethnicity & Television(3)This course examines race and ethnicity in American television from the 1950s to the present. More specifically, it explores the social, political, historical and institutional contexts that have shaped representations of Asian/Americans, Latino/as, and African Americans on television. By analyzing racial and ethnic images within the development of television, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complex histories that shaped the formation of each ethnic group. While the focus of the course centers on the politics of representation, it moves the discussion beyond the question of stereotypes to explore how concepts such as Orientalism, whiteness, multiculturalism, and post-race contribute to our understanding of racial politics in the United States.COMM 4300Cultural Politics & Cinema(3)This course examines the relationship between media, society, and political discourse as they manifest in the complexities of cultural production beyond US borders.

This course emphasizes program design process, object-oriented software development approach, and development of practical programming skills that translate to programming in other modern languages.  This is a stand-alone introductory computer science course that is not a part of the coordinate major in computer science program. It is aimed at students with no prior computing background who wish to learn the foundations of programming and computational problem solving.CMPS 1500Intro to Computer Science I(4)Computational tools are a critical part of our everyday lives. Software is the driving force behind cutting-edge scientific discovery, blockbuster entertainment, and today's fast-paced marketplace. This course is an introduction to techniques, ideas, and problem-solving approaches that are used to develop some of these tools. At a high level, we focus on developing \"computational thinking\", which is the practice of using abstraction to design and implement algorithms and software to solve problems that arise in many different areas of our daily lives, such as networks, social media, and scientific computing, to name just a few. At a practical level, students will design, implement, test and document their programs to learn introductory programming concepts, such as: data types and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries, trees); programming techniques (modular design using functions, recursion, object-oriented programming); performance analysis via theoretical estimate, profiling and timing.  Most assignments in this course are programming assignments aimed to teach the students to express their ideas in efficient and elegant code; no prior programming experience is necessary to join and succeed in the course. Lecture periods are dedicated to introducing new material, discussions, individual and group activities.  Lab periods are used for programming practice.CMPS\u00a01500is the first course for the Coordinate Major in Computer Science.\nCorequisite(s):CMPS\u00a01501.Corequisite(s):CMPS\u00a01501.CMPS 1501Intro to Computer Sci I Lab(0)Corequisite lab ofCMPS\u00a01500.Corequisite(s):CMPS\u00a01500.CMPS 1600Intro to Computer Science II(4)This is the second course in the introductory course sequence for Coordinate Major in Computer Science and is the continuation ofCMPS\u00a01500. WhileCMPS\u00a01500focuses on a broad array of topics in computer science and a single language (Python), this class focuses on several core topics in the design, analysis and implementation of computational tools that are drawn from the fields of data structures, software engineering, and programming languages (such as Java, C, Haskell): object-oriented programming, test-driven development; data structures and abstract data types; imperative programming and memory management; functional programming. By solving practical, real-life problems in different programming languages and in different ways, students learn to select a language and approach most appropriate for the situation, and prepare to learn new languages independently. The high-level goal of this course is to train students to be able to draw from a versatile set of skills, which in turn will provide a strong foundation for further study in computer science.  \nPrerequisite(s):CMPS\u00a01500.\nCorequisite(s):CMPS\u00a01601.Prerequisite(s):CMPS\u00a01500.Corequisite(s):CMPS\u00a01601.CMPS 1601Intro to Comp Science II Lab(0)Corequisite lab ofCMPS\u00a01600.

As developers, we know that immersion is everything. When you\u2019re immersed you lose track of time and become involved in what the game is presenting. A major factor in what makes or breaks immersion is how easy it is for your player to convert an idea into an in-game action -- that is, how fluid your game\u2019s User Experience (UX) is and how well-designed its User Interface (UI) is. A game hurts itself by providing too little information or too much, requiring too many inputs, confusing the player with unhelpful prompts or making it hard for a new player to interact.

Class presentations and discussions will examine the various issues relevant to the design and implementation of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction plans and actions including costs, benefits, legal issues, impact on development, environmental links and concerns, as well as governance issues. Students will analyze the assessment of climate-related risk and the design methods and technological tools used to develop and implement climate and hazard risk reduction plans and actions. The role and leadership of stakeholders from the public and private sectors will be closely examined. Case studies will be introduced to generate examination of and discussions on the ways climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction actions have been successfully implemented and how local, regional and national governments are working to integrate these two activities.DRLS 6050Leadership(3)This course will dive into recent disasters as the backdrop to explore how theories of leadership ring true or are challenged in practice. Students will be invited to recognize that leaders in the disaster space must be students of people - their needs, motivations, and expectations. Students will have the opportunity to hear from a number of seasoned leaders who will speak to experiences navigating policy, power dynamics and personalities. The course will conclude with the opportunity for students to identify traits and behaviors of leaders to be emulated and to craft those into a personal development roadmap for use in their careers as leaders in the disaster space.DRLS 6060Disasters and Social Justice(3)\"The course offers an interdisciplinary exploration of the ways in which disasters disproportionately affect different communities across the US and internationally. Why are some individuals or communities more vulnerable than others? The course will use the feminist sociological theory of \u201cintersectionality\u201d an underlying theory and mode of looking at the multiple identifies that affect one\u2019s ability to prepare, respond or recover from disasters. We will look at what role issues of race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity, class, age, dis/ability, sexual orientation and other social categories play in disaster resilience and management. \nThe overall objective of this course is to gain a holistic understanding of the unnatural phenomenon of environmental disasters, including the social construction of disasters, environmental justice, disaster capitalism, normalization of deviance, Black Swan theory, individual blame logic and contaminated communities.  Case studies - of local, national and international disasters - will be used to illustrate the principles involved. \nThe course will combine theory with practical approaches to the issue, drawing on resources from different disciplines with a particular focus on the fields of sociology, social work, environmental and social justice, disaster management, community psychology, health, cross-cultural studies and urban planning. \n\"DRLS 6070Program Dev & Grant Management(3)This course will provide future disaster resilience leaders with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop a competitive grant proposal to secure external funding from government agencies, corporations, and private foundations.

Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets. This course develops the main concepts and tools of game theory with the aim to enable you to read original game-theoretic literature and to prepare you to do research in the field. The course first examines the foundations of game theory, using simple examples familiar from introductory microeconomics classes.

As a common French saying has it, \"Paris, c'est la France\" - \"Paris is France.\" Yet for generations the face of Paris has been shaped not just by the French of the Hexagon, but by diverse groups of immigrants, ranging from East European emigres to inhabitants of France's former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. Indeed, immigration has made Paris so cosmopolitan that we might ask to what degree it truly embodies \"Frenchness\" today.

For description, consult the department.HIST 1520Pain & Torture Through History(3)A seminar course for first year students designed to introduce college level reading, discussion and writing. The UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1987 unequivocally banned the use of torture. Nevertheless torture still occurs, even in the 130 countries that ratified the agreement.There is a great deal of controversy about what constitutes torture and some claim that it is justified in special situations like the War on Terror.This course will examine the goals and methods of torture through history, as it moved from a focus of inflicting pain to the use of psychological torture and sensory deprivation. We will explore how to study pain in history - does pain exist as an entity; unravel the changing relationships between the state, law, and torture; look at the torturers themselves - who they are, how they learn the techniques, and the effects on them. We will also consider what it says about us when we pursue \"enhanced\" quasi-torture interrogation techniques.HIST 1750Disasters in History(3)Disasters have taken many forms in human history, from earthquakes, fires, tsunamis and hurricanes to famine and epidemic disease. Nor should we forget manmade tragedies such as the terrorist attacks on 9/11 or the devastation produced by a combination of human and technological failures, such as the explosions at Chernobyl and Bhopal or the more recent BP oil spill just off of our own coast. Disasters are an important focus for historical inquiry for quite varied reasons. This is a unique course. It will be team-taught by 12 professors. Each professor will teach a 1-week unit on a historical disaster related to their area of specialization. In addition to an excellent learning experience, you will get to sample the teaching of more than half of the faculty members in the History Department.HIST 1760Eating & Drinking in History(3)Eating and Drinking are part of our everyday lives and experiences, and in that respect, these processes can seem natural rather than historical. However, if we stop and think about it, the politics, economics, and culture of food production and consumption have shaped communities and cultures in specific, and often divergent, ways.  In this course, we will take the overarching rubric of eating and drinking to explore the multiple ways in which studying food can illuminate our understanding of the past.  This course will include units on food, war, and hunger; commodity chains and trade; cultural relationships with alcohol; and labor and food production in the pre-industrial, industrial and post-industrial era. This is a team taught class taught by the History faculty.  Each professor will teach a 1-week unit on eating and drinking related to their area of specialization.HIST 1910Special Topics(3)Courses offered by visiting professors or permanent faculty.

Cases marry learning about real world policy and organizational problems with critical thinking, abstract reasoning, and theorizing valued in all academic disciplines. The objective of this course is to engage students in drawing leadership lessons from the real-world dilemmas of women leading organizations to bring about social change.  The course will also teach how to write and evaluate the usefulness of cases; each student will write a case linked to her field of study which engages the concepts of gender and leadership.  The course teaches critical thinking and problem solving through immersion in the stories of women leaders.  The course outcomes are an enhanced appreciation of the dilemmas that are encountered by women leading change; the ability to evaluate and compose case studies at the intersection of leadership and gender; and the demonstration of strategic thinking and problem-solving skill.\n\nPrerequisite(s):INTU\u00a01000.Prerequisite(s):INTU\u00a01000.INTU 2020Wellness & Resilience for College & Beyond(1)College is an exciting and stressful time for everyone. The increased freedom and independence are both exciting and daunting, leading many students to struggle in new ways or with emotions that seem to have increased in intensity. Conversely, research has shown that individuals who develop and use resilience strategies and emotion regulation skills (such as opposite action, relaxation strategies, mindfulness, and practicing gratitude) as well as build positive routines (for example, good eating and sleep habits, daily exercising, scheduling fun activities) are more likely to be effective in their job roles, involved in strong relationships, physically and mentally healthy, and satisfied with their lives overall.INTU 2500Digital Scholarship(1)This course examines practices for designing research communications across a variety of digital mediums.

This course explores the origins of this first of the great Abrahamic faiths. Where does Judaism come from? What is the relationship between Judaism and the Hebrew Bible (also called the Tanakh or Old Testament)? Who holds power in Judaism, and where does this authority originate?

How did this non-religious orientation arise amongst what many people consider to be a religious community? We will explore how certain non-religious features, such as shared culture, language, custom, dress, and education played an integral part in the definition of Jews and Judaism from their inception, and the role played by these features in the constitution of variant secular forms of Judaism and secular Jewish orientations in the modern period.JWST 1290Semester Abroad(1-20)Semester Abroad.\nCourse may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99JWST 1890Service Learning(0-1)Students complete a service activity in the community in conjunction with the content of a three-credit co-requisite course.

In this course, we will learn about the major sections of the ADA (also known as \u201cTitles\u201d), and about the key concepts embodied in the legislation, and created through subsequent federal court cases. Our primary focus is the application of the ADA in private and public employment, although we will also more briefly review the application of the ADA in other spheres. Topics include, but are not limited to: definition of disability, definition of employer, prohibited acts, reasonable accommodation, qualified individuals, essential job functions, substance abuse, defenses to the charge of disability discrimination (including direct threat, undue hardship, and fundamental alteration), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and interactive process.EMPL 5000Developing & Manage Workforce(2)Human resources (HR) management can be defined as the effective use of human capital in an organization through the management of people-related activities. It involves leadership, values, workforce planning, recruitment and selection, training and compensation, and performance evaluation and management. HR also significantly influences the corporate culture and values/mission of the company. To thrive in a competitive business environment, organizations need more than just strategic plans in place. They need the right talent to implement those plans. Those who manage human resources\u2014not just HR departments, but all managers\u2014have a critical task in front of them. They have to identify, recruit and retain employees who have both the skill sets and determination to effectively implement strategic objectives in their individual departments, so the business plan succeeds as a whole.

If employees create works\u00ad\u00ad\u2014websites, inventions, newsletters, etc. within their job, additional issues will arise, both in terms of who owns the creations, but also what materials the employee is using to create those works. Copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, and right of publicity are implicated in the hiring and employing of both individuals and other companies. IP policies related to social media also are important to establish, both for the company in general, and individuals within the company, which should be communicated to employees in an effective way. Finally, situations come up where employees are using equipment at work to create after\u00adhours creations, or are creating commercially viable creations at home. Human resources, in administering hiring documents both for employees and independent contractors should be aware of the legal issues that arise, as well as the policy behind the choices.EMPL 5710Intro to Labor Law Principles(3)This course is created and taught by the Program Director, Prof. Joel Wm.

We will discuss fundamental principles and sources of contract law, but we will approach all aspects of the course from the practical perspective of transactional lawyers and business professionals who must work collaboratively to negotiate, draft, implement, and manage written business contracts. Students will learn how to translate business deal terms into contract provisions that achieve appropriate legal consequences and manage risk. Students will analyze different types of negotiated business agreements and provisions (with a focus on employment-related contracts) and learn contemporary commercial drafting techniques to manage risk, minimize ambiguity, and solve problems through effective drafting.Prerequisite(s):EMPL\u00a06400and6401.EMPL 6460Employment Law(2)This course will provide students with an understanding of the legal underpinnings of the employer-employee relationship, including the employment-at-will doctrine which is the default setting for the relationship. The course will discuss the limits of the employment-at-will doctrine as well as common legal claims brought in the employment context. It will also explore issues such as privacy expectations of employees and the enforceability of covenants not to compete as well as laws impacting employee compensation and leave.EMPL 6500Employee Medical Leaves(2)An employee comes to you with a doctor\u2019s note asking for time off from work.\u00a0 Sounds simple, right?\u00a0 Not really.\u00a0 That request could be covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, your state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law, your policies, and more.\u00a0In this class you will learn how to navigate the often-overlapping legal requirements for medical leave and reinstatement issues.\u00a0 You will also learn how to discuss and document key decisions about the leave in a way that minimizes the risk of litigation.EMPL 6510Administrative Law(2)The course explores the history, present status and nature of administrative agencies. The main emphasis is placed on administrative procedure, contrasting it with the judicial process, as well as constitutional limits on administrative action and the due process rights of persons who are adversely affected by agency action. Topics covered will include delegation of powers, the law of judicial review of\nagency actions, and procedural requirements of administrative rule-making and adjudication.EMPL 6600Privacy in the Workplace(2)Privacy is a dynamic issue of concern in essentially every modern workplace. However, there is no comprehensive statute governing workplace privacy. Existing laws usually address (or marginally relate to) one discreet area of privacy law. Because privacy law is decentralized by nature, you must understand its general framework to properly address privacy questions that arise in the workplace. You must also be familiar with, or at least capable of referencing, a wide array of federal, state and local privacy laws. This course will cover both the general framework of privacy law and the most notable statutes addressing workplace privacy.", "start_char_idx": 8232, "end_char_idx": 13669, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca67ba62-3d68-4742-966b-7d36836c5bd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca67ba62-3d68-4742-966b-7d36836c5bd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Labor.txt", "file_name": "Labor.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17625, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87760fa4-d8c9-44df-8f3e-0c7b9ff8913a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Labor.txt", "file_name": "Labor.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17625, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "6189be19e38ddd6316c293f63a4da5bdda189d2ddce258cf8d942d2de5ebbbfb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e89014b-6fc5-40bf-b2e1-13b7fbcb8343", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Labor.txt", "file_name": "Labor.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17625, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "c30da8337fd48159a4df8a0681f8f299216d9a45bdcfcc33777dfc98cb6f8beb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The main emphasis is placed on administrative procedure, contrasting it with the judicial process, as well as constitutional limits on administrative action and the due process rights of persons who are adversely affected by agency action.

You must also be familiar with, or at least capable of referencing, a wide array of federal, state and local privacy laws. This course will cover both the general framework of privacy law and the most notable statutes addressing workplace privacy. The course begins with an overview of the origins and legal sources of privacy law. The course then covers specific areas of workplace privacy, including medical inquiries; background and misconduct investigations; monitoring and surveillance; honesty, psychological, drug and alcohol testing; medical and personnel records; off-duty conduct; employer information; and privacy tort claims. As to each topic, you will gain an understanding of governing legal standards and best practices through reading materials, examples, and when appropriate, checklists and sample policies.EMPL 6910Intro to Employment Discrim(3)This course is created and taught by the Program Director, Prof. Joel Wm. Friedman, a nationally renowned expert in the field of labor and employment law. It is designed to provide the students with a thorough understanding of all of the legal rules and concepts created by federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination on the bases of race, sex, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, and national origin in a very practical way. The materials will be presented in a manner dedicated to enhancing the ability of present or future human resource professionals to deal with specific problems that continually arise in the workplace. Instruction will be directed towards providing advice on how to deal with and avoid problems in areas including racial and sexual harassment, religious accommodation, pregnancy and family leave, LBGT concerns, handling EEOC investigations, drafting personnel manuals, avoiding retaliation claims, mandatory and voluntary retirement, disability-based accommodation, and drug testing.EMPL 6920Introduction to Employee Benefits Law(2)In this course we will examine the legal regulation of employee benefits with a focus on health care benefits, retirement benefits, employee stock options, and other employee welfare benefits. In addition to providing information about the legal operation of various types of employee benefits, we will also examine what such plans require in terms of fiduciaries and how these plans are to be regulated in the event of bankruptcy. The bulk of our engagement will be with the federal law. Throughout the course we will engage with the current legal and political frameworks, as well as legislative developments in this field and discuss where things are headed.Prerequisite(s):EMPL\u00a05710and6910.EMPL 6990Capstone Course(3)This course is designed to build upon the doctrinal and practical and strategic knowledge and skills students have acquired during their first five semesters. Students will be assigned to groups of three or four so that they can gain experience in team building, group dynamics, and collegial decision-making. Each team will be required to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the course instructor who will provide the basic underlying materials and will represent the interests of the fictional labor union. Once that agreement has been executed, each student will be responsible for drafting each of the four additional projects: (a) a grievance and arbitration policy and procedure: (b) a personnel policy; (c) a sexual harassment policy and enforcement mechanism; (d) a drug testing policy and enforcement mechanism.EMPL 9000Immersion Weekend(0)Students will need to attend at least one Immersion Weekend during their time in the program. These sessions are held every summer, so students can plan to attend during either their first or second year in the program, but the experience of prior students indicates that the session is most beneficial to those who attend in their first year. It is both an academic and networking opportunity for students to meet their classmates, professors, and other professionals working in the area of labor and employment law. The occasion will include a keynote speaker, lectures and workshops from industry experts, and a variety of social activities.", "start_char_idx": 12579, "end_char_idx": 17588, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed2a23c7-228d-475f-9a1a-2957f771071c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed2a23c7-228d-475f-9a1a-2957f771071c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Latin.txt", "file_name": "Latin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10304, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8d6336df-9ad6-48d6-9752-01c103ba7252", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Latin.txt", "file_name": "Latin.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 10304, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "83e6e18acadb32faa88b896211e1339222eca9ab0f3e3c2fa6f2f4917f329938", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "37fc8e3a-a0e4-4f55-af49-5e1cfa0777ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f464a6b3016472c3d2e8e776b9dd152691df384e030077b5d78178f368250a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "LATN 1010Elementary Latin(4)In this course, students learn the fundamentals of Latin grammar and syntax so that they can begin reading snippets of Latin literature.LATN 1020Intermediate Latin(4)This course continues the introduction to the Latin language begun inLATN\u00a01010, including pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, style, and translation.

Dictionaries take many forms and fulfill many functions. Dictionaries have evolved new formats; professional lexicographers share word gleaning with internet users. Dictionaries may be monolingual, di-, tri-, or multi-lingual, etymological or encyclopedic, synchronic or diachronic, prescriptive or descriptive, terminological or generic. Dictionary construction requires a number of skills which co-vary with the type of dictionary to be produced. This course provides an overview of dictionaries, their forms, formats and histories, while fostering a basic skill set for harvesting words and compiling lexicons. Dictionaries provide a cognitive map to communities of speakers, both past and present.\nNotes: Writing Practica OptionLING 3700Second Language Acquisition(3)This course is intended to familiarize students with the field of Second Language Acquisition, including a history of the field's origins.

Principles of persuasion when applied to the sales domain are referred to as personal selling or professional selling.  While salespeople do try and build a reputation for their company and the products they are selling, their personal reputation tends to be primary. Personal branding by salespeople is often seen as establishing trust. Sales management, although it has some unique elements to it, is very much like the management of every workplace organization. Good management requires, principally, good leadership, which in turn enables good selection, training and motivation, and, though often not emphasized, a good moral code. Since there are a large number of sales employees in this country \u2013 about one in every ten employees is identified as a salesperson \u2013 their personal happiness, not just their effectiveness, becomes an important issue to study. Since happiness correlates with turnover, and high turnover can compromise good sales management, all three criteria\u2013effectiveness, happiness, and retention\u2013are important sales management concerns.\nPrerequisite(s):MKTG\u00a03010.Prerequisite(s):MKTG\u00a03010.MKTG 4230Global Marketing(3)This course takes a multidisciplinary approach, including concepts from marketing, sociology, political science and economics, to examine the issues associated with marketing across borders.", "start_char_idx": 4115, "end_char_idx": 8904, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab0ccfee-f750-45ac-9650-abfa1c4ddeea": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab0ccfee-f750-45ac-9650-abfa1c4ddeea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Marketing.txt", "file_name": "Marketing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23918, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2c79381-6a78-4fb8-bd2d-31725d4c5722", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Marketing.txt", "file_name": "Marketing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23918, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "4c815a6d81000bfd8eb1461c77909b91365ef45e0c9b09a6616ce9fe29dfcef2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdfb44cc-14db-45df-bc92-222d08769d50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Marketing.txt", "file_name": "Marketing.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23918, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "bd078d9b2768d6bf1891363eddfb133bdac8366bbe8b03bb793460b5a1bbc304", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fda99f3f-5d25-4675-8d31-2094b689d96c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c61c7bbfa0d9b66dbf9c5f477122fc5c6077ee4fb93ab4199a0912d99f82b17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sales management, although it has some unique elements to it, is very much like the management of every workplace organization.

We will examine their understanding of political life and the place of the individual in society, exploring the questions they raise that remain of central importance in our world today: What is justice? What is a citizen? Why is the rule of law desirable? What is the relation between freedom and equality in democracy?MLAR 7020Modern Political Thought(3)This course will be devoted to a study of classical works of modern political philosophy in the Western tradition.  How did the early modern political philosophers try to make a new beginning by turning to a realism they thought missing in the ancients?  How did they go about defending individual rights in society on that basis?  We will examine Machiavelli\u2019s introduction of this approach, and its development in the political theories of thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau.MLAR 7030Masterwrks West Lit Foundation(3)This course will examine literary texts, ancient and medieval, that have played an important role in shaping Western thought and imagination.  We will explore the understanding of the human condition that comes to light in works such as the Bible, the Homeric poems, Greek tragedy, the dialogues of Plato, the writings of Augustine or Dante, among others.MLAR 7040Masterworks of Western Literature in the Modern Era(3)This course will examine literary texts central to the Western tradition from the Renaissance to the present.  We will explore the understanding of the human condition that comes to light in works such as those of Cervantes, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Kafka, Toni Morrison, and others.MLAR 7050Understanding Amer Foundations(3)This course is an intense analytical investigation of social, political, economic, religious, and philosophical issues in the early years of the American republic. The course examines the people and events of the founding of the American republic from the revolution, through the creation of the American Constitution, and culminating in the election of 1800. This course is primarily an intellectual history course and the main scholarly work that we will read is the work of historians, but the course also delves deeply into issues in political theory, political economy, and political and social philosophy.  The course charts the development of American political ideas about constitutionalism, governance, political freedom, economic freedom, representative democracy, republicanism, and federalism primarily from the vantage point of the careers of two of the main figures from this period, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. The views of other figures will also be central to our investigation, particularly the views of James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. The student will be challenged to examine fundamental assumptions about these topics in order to rethink the intellectual origins of the American political tradition in its founding years.MLAR 7060Understanding Amer Modern Era(3)This course is an intense encounter with the work of perhaps the most significant, original, and influential philosopher in American history, Richard Rorty (1931-2007). The material that we read will cover all the main aspects of Rorty's philosophical and political work. The main focus of the course will be an attempt to come to terms with Rorty's critique of the cult and culture of professional philosophy. We will also be concerned with an attempt to understand Rorty as a major figure in the American intellectual tradition and locate him within the history that includes such figures as Emerson, Whitman, William James, John Dewey, and other figures considered to be exemplars of naturalism, pragmatism, or neo-pragmatism in one form or another.MLAR 7070Political World(3)This course examines the political economy of food by exploring the processes of production, regulation, and consumption that determine the relationships between humans and the food we eat in the world today. We will explore the moral, political, social, and economic dimensions of this topic with the goal of providing a platform for personal exploration and transformation. The presentation of material in the course is designed to be engaging, provocative, and stimulating and to provide the student with an opportunity to make informed decisions about the moral and political dimensions of their own relationship to food.MLAR 7080The Economic World(3)This course examines the causes and consequences of the Great Recession, the economic crisis of 2008 and beyond.  Over the past thirty years, the economic and political landscape of the world has been transformed by sweeping economic changes that reflect the influence of the once marginalized but now dominant ideology of neo-liberalism and free market fundamentalism.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4904, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d01dd0c-36f6-4a85-8dc9-4084ce03053a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d01dd0c-36f6-4a85-8dc9-4084ce03053a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7317e044-ae8c-467a-8ce4-375e359ad769", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "27f5b8e496a1894e42f92f242655b768f5c62c1c5b2abfcc681e96c2a1a22522", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8c5f85e-ffd8-4fc1-a283-3624e979a620", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "d811b111a06934d5d97a62e4e5d1d37079296c0fd0baf906b1cb12c6f6c45e36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7139ba3d-3e05-4de0-9b0e-78592a1365b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73cc63672cff85fdbf56c1c67f4309fd0bb76d76cbd0531394fa0e376b8992e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We will explore the moral, political, social, and economic dimensions of this topic with the goal of providing a platform for personal exploration and transformation.

Over the past thirty years, the economic and political landscape of the world has been transformed by sweeping economic changes that reflect the influence of the once marginalized but now dominant ideology of neo-liberalism and free market fundamentalism. These changes have created the greatest accumulation of individual wealth in human history, but also have arguably created greater suffering, poverty, inequality, anti-democratic developments, and the growing potential for the catastrophic failure of the global economy, as evidenced by recent events. We will consider a variety of political and economic views of the Great Recession, from a broad spectrum of economic and political thinkers.MLAR 7100Special Topics(3)Special topics in liberal arts.MLAR 7101Special Topics(3)Special topics in liberal arts.Maximum Hours:99MLAR 7102Special Topics(3)Special topics in liberal arts.MLAR 7103Special Topics(3)Special topics in liberal arts.MLAR 7113Philosophy of Religion(3)This course will analyze various ways of understanding the nature and importance of religious experience and religious beliefs.  We will consider some of the most influential arguments for the existence of God and examine central issues such as the problem of evil or the relation between revelation and reason.MLAR 7122King Arthur: History & Legend(3)In this course, we will investigate the evidence, both textual and archaeological, for the existence of an historical Arthur, King of the Britons, and will then consider how that evidence was transformed into an imaginative cycle of stories concerning kingship and chivalry that were highly influential within and beyond the Middle Ages.  We will pay particular attention to three themes:  the ideals of monarchy and knightly behavior that inform the Arthurian stories (e.g. the medieval theory of the divine right of kings); the development within the Arthurian materials of ideas about medieval romantic love or fin amor, especially in representations of the passionate but doomed relationship between Lancelot and Guinevere; and the mystical dimensions of Arthurian romance, as these emerged from writings about the Round Table fellowship's pursuit of the Holy Grail.  We will read Sir Thomas Malory's late medieval revision of the Arthurian story cycle, but with reference to other non-Malory materials to be introduced and explained by the instructor (e.g. a long alliterative poem concerning Arthur's battle with the giant of St. Michael's Mount).  We will also deal briefly at the end of the course with Victorian adaptations of the Arthurian materials, especially those by Tennyson in his Idylls of the King and William Morris in his Defence of Guenevere. Three written assignments:  a midterm and final examination (essay format) and a short critical paper (5 pp. typed, double-spaced). Required Text:  Sir Thomas Malory, Le Morte Darthur:  The Winchester Manuscript, ed. by Helen Cooper (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 2008).MLAR 7123Robin Hood(3)This course will explore the legendary history of the medieval outlaw figure, Robin Hood, as it developed through the Medieval and Early Modern periods and into our own century.  We will begin by examining historical and archaeological evidence for the person \"Robin Hood\" (including pre-Christian influences on his character) and then will consider Robin Hood's complex literary and cultural identity.  We will also be concerned with various political uses to which the figure of Robin Hood was put in the Medieval and Early Modern periods and with Robin Hood's persistent role in modern British and American popular culture, especially the movies. Three written assignments:  a midterm and final examination (essay format) and a short critical paper (5 pp. typed, double-spaced). Required Texts:  Stephen Knight and Thomas Ohlgren, eds., Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales, 2d ed.

The Famine or the Great Hunger killed approximately one million Irish, forcing the emigration of another two million, and altering not only the history of Ireland, but also the history of Britain, Australia, Canada, and the United States. This course will concentrate on the seminal issues concerning the Famine: Ireland's political and social relationship with British society, the tortured relationship between landlord and tenant, the desperate poverty which afflicted the Irish underclass and threatened much of the population with ruin, the bitter sectarian conflicts which convulsed the island and tainted its political and economic arrangements, and Ireland's struggle for self-determination. We will discuss the causes of the Famine (which were different from the blight which attacked the potato), the domestic and international responses to it, and its consequences for Ireland, Britain, and the United States. This course is a seminar and will emphasize reading, discussion, and writing.MLAR 7126Tudors in TV and Film(3)This course will look at popular depictions of Henry VIII, Thomas Cromwell, Catherine of Aragon, and Anne Boleyn. We will explore questions about creators of historical fiction: Do they have obligations to their audience and to the memory of the dead?  Are there some cases in which it is particular important to achieve historical accuracy and others not?MLAR 7129Canterbury Tales(3)This course will investigate the medieval phenomenon of pilgrimage\u2014or religious vacationing\u2014by way of a reading of one of the classics of English literature, Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th c. masterpiece, The Canterbury Tales.  In addition to the motif of devotional journeying, we will study the different medieval social classes (knights, clerics, and peasants) and story types (chivalric romances, fabliaux or bawdy tales, saints lives) that Chaucer explores in his literary masterwork.MLAR 7130Love/Romance in Lit & Film(3)In this course we will look at the portrayal of love, romance, and marriage in modern society in short stories, plays and films.MLAR 7132Masculinities(3)What does it mean to be \u201cmasculine\u201d? What effects does the concept of \u201cmasculinity\u201d have on men, on women, and on society? Until recently, masculinity was considered \u201cnatural\u201d for \u201creal men.\u201d Recently, however, traditional notions have been challenged by economic crises, social conditions, feminists, and men who do not \u201cfit\u201d the characteristics of \u201ctraditional\u201d masculinity. This class takes a critical look at the concept of \u201cmasculinity,\u201d particularly \u201chegemonic masculinity,\u201d its domination of various \u201csub\u201d masculinities, and its constructions in popular culture. Through readings, lectures, class discussions, and analyses of films and other cultural elements, we examine what it means to conform to and challenge \u201chegemonic masculinity\u201d in the United States over the last half century or so.MLAR 7133Culture & Politics of Marriage(3)Although today there are numerous ways to construct a family in America, marriage continues to be the preferred option. Nearly 100% of Americans routinely report a desire to marry at some point in their lives. Roughly 90% of them do marry at least once, and over half do it more than once. Yet soaring divorce rates point to a disconnect between what we expect marriage to be and what it actually is. As young children, we're told that marrying our prince/princess will ensure us a happily ever after, as it did for Cinderella, and this cultural message only gets stronger as we grow up. We're so bombarded by these assurances that we take it for granted that we must marry our prince or princess just to be happy. For this reason, we rarely stop to consider that marriage is a social institution that creates, reinforces, and reflects power and hierarchy.", "start_char_idx": 8041, "end_char_idx": 12569, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecfe30bd-40d7-49dd-9e7f-c3577dd10945": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecfe30bd-40d7-49dd-9e7f-c3577dd10945", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7317e044-ae8c-467a-8ce4-375e359ad769", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "27f5b8e496a1894e42f92f242655b768f5c62c1c5b2abfcc681e96c2a1a22522", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7139ba3d-3e05-4de0-9b0e-78592a1365b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "5843c0d7324ba42ada90b4ec1e8cef74587d59d7e43c702885f73ac416fd1732", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f88f4fc-5eb6-4e2b-bd3e-4a6fec3ddd8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf6bd33192d120ce400b05343afc5ffaa94e9c1743fdc4db649e590b09d5a2f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Nearly 100% of Americans routinely report a desire to marry at some point in their lives.

For this reason, we rarely stop to consider that marriage is a social institution that creates, reinforces, and reflects power and hierarchy. This is a master's level seminar on the social institution of marriage. This course engages questions such as: What is marriage? Where does our notion of marriage come from? How does popular culture act to construct and reinforce that notion and make it part of our taken-for-granted stock of knowledge? How do our idealized notions of marriage differ from our practice of marriage? What politics are implicated in our idealized notions about marriage, and how do those politics play out in the practice of marriage? Drawing on class readings, discussions, and exercises, we engage these issues (and more) as part of the ongoing family values debate that questions whether marriage is in crisis or simply in transition. The intent of this course is to make students aware of some of the hidden forces that shape our contemporary attitudes and ongoing cultural debates about marriage and family.MLAR 7134History, Power and the State(3)This course will explore the theme of power and the state through a study of films, such as \u201cThe Man for All Seasons,\u201d \u201cAmistad,\u201d \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d or \u201cBook Thief.\u201d  We will discuss the historical accuracy of the films, asking what they can teach us, both about the period depicted and the period in which they were made, considering in particular the way people have thought about power and the state.MLAR 7135Huey Long in Literature & Film(3)This course will consider the life of Huey Pierce Long as depicted in biography and film. It will discuss and analyze three major biographical and literary works about Long: Alan Brinkley's comparative biography Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father Coughlin, and the Great Depression, Richard D. White, Jr.'s Kingfish The Reign of Huey P. Long, and Robert Penn Warren's classic political novel, All the King's Men. The course will also view and analyze two films about Huey Long: Ken Burns's documentary Huey Long and an Academy Award film based on Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men. The course will also discuss and assess Long's life in light of other writings on the history of Louisiana, the South, and nation from the 1890s through the 1930s.MLAR 7136Philosophy of Art(3)This course is an examination of central philosophical questions about the nature of art.  We will examine philosophers' responses to questions such as: what is art? Does art differ from craft? Must art be beautiful? Is art universal or the same across cultures? Are there objective standards for determining the value of a piece of art? What is the relationship of aesthetic value to moral value, and what role (if any) does art play in social justice? We will also examine issues that arise in relation to particular art forms, including poetry, music, painting, dance, and theater.MLAR 7137Love and Death in Lit and Film(3)In this course we analyze the representation of love and death in works of literature and cinema.

We will consider the relation between the two: Why does utopia so often turn into dystopia? What are the elements of a perfect society? Why have all attempts to create a utopian society failed, at least so far?MLAR 7157Witchcraft Early Modern Europe(3)In this course students analyze the causes of the rise of witchcraft prosecution in late medieval and early modern Europe (roughly 1300-1700), while also examining recent historiographical trends in early modern witchcraft research.   Topics include the relationship between gender and witchcraft, as well as the effects of  social, political, and religious change  on witchcraft accusations and trials.MLAR 7160Contempry Culture in Lit/Film(3)In this course we will look at problems in our contemporary culture as they have been represented in short stories, plays, and films.MLAR 7161Civil War New Orleans(3)This course is a seminar which emphasizes reading, discussion, research, and writing.\u00a0 Despite the contentions of some historians, the Civil War had a profound impact on the people and history of New Orleans. During the late antebellum period (1840s-1850s), the city was the principal slave market in the nation. This domestic trade fueled the lower south and New Orleans' economic development. Slavery shaped the economic and social character of the south, over the years creating not only a society with slaves, but also a slave society. Despite its dominance and apparent unanimity, slavery was also a contentious and divisive institution. Slavery in New Orleans was no exception to these twin dynamics.  The historical records, newspapers, acts of sales, successions, census records, and private correspondence demonstrate the centrality of slavery to New Orleans' antebellum society. On the other hand, the city's complex racial, ethnic, and sectional composition heightened political and social tensions, raising suspicions and fears about racial identity, naturalization and citizenship, and loyalty. Slavery and ethnicity shaped issues of civil liberties, criminal justice, and politics. The presidential and secession elections of 1860 and 1861 sharply divided New Orleans, as they did throughout much of the urban south. These divisions did not disappear with mobilization and civil war, but were only intensified in the hothouse of occupation, reunion, reconstruction, and, above all, loss. New Orleans suffered greatly during and after the Civil War. Thousands of men were killed or died from wounds and disease and even more were maimed physically and scared emotionally. The fighting ended, but the war continued beyond Appomattox Court House. To this day, the privileges and immunities of American citizens are intensely debated, bringing not only hope but also rancor and division, as much as they did in antebellum New Orleans and America.MLAR 7166Genocide as a Political Weapon(3)This course examines the character of genocide in the modern world, from the killing of the Armenians during World War I to events in Rwanda and Bosnia.

Readings include a wide range of sociological, historical, and anthropological studies of ethno-racial vision and division, accommodation, and conflict in Latin America, Asia, Western Europe, the United States, and Africa. They are geared toward helping us uncover the social mechanisms that lead to the rise, reproduction, and transformation of ethno-racial inequality, wherever and whenever it is found. This course is problem-oriented, not group-oriented; its purpose is neither to celebrate nor to denigrate the experiences of this or that particular category but to explain and understand them in sociological terms.MLAR 7210Language, Power, & Identity(3)Language is a powerful mode through which identities and social norms are created, negotiated, and transformed.  This course will examine how people use language to enact different cultural, social, or linguistic identities, and how language ideologies impact the understanding and reception of those enactments.  We will also explore how people\u2019s language beliefs and practices support or challenge dominant power structures and mainstream discourses. Readings will include critical theoretical perspectives on language and discourse, focusing on topics that include multilingualism, code-switching, language loss, microaggressions, and domestic and global language policies.MLAR 7215Asian Philosophy(3)This course studies the major intellectual traditions of India and China, including Hindu and early Buddhist thought in India, as well as Confucian, Taoist, and later Buddhist thought in China.MLAR 7220Digital Cultures(3)This course will critically explore participation in digital communities, including social networks, blogs, intellectual, political and civic collaborations, and emerging digital cultures and art forms. Through sociocultural perspectives on multimodal discourses, we will examine the relationship between technology and culture, community, identity/representation, language and power, and social activism in global digital communities.MLAR 7235Women in Global Societies(3)This course engages with transnational, postcolonial, Black, and Chicana feminist theories to examine how different sociopolitical contexts intersect with women\u2019s experiences around the world. In particular, we consider how place, nationality, sexuality, religion, culture, and class impact women\u2019s everyday lives while analyzing how women navigate and challenge dominant social structures. Course topics will focus on the experiences of women in relation to identity, migration, representation, and economic development.MLAR 7240Justice, Law & Public Policy(3)This course will examine considerations of justice and morality that help shape law and public policy.\u00a0 Issues to be discussed may include:\u00a0 crime and punishment, drugs, gun control, treatment of enemy combatants, torture, surveillance and privacy, free speech and national security.MLAR 7245Medieval New Orleans(3)By way of numerous Power Point tours of on and off campus sites and materials, as well as our reading of a popular American novel, Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, this course will consider the influence of medieval culture and ideas on New Orleans and, to some extent, Southern culture in general, especially during the post-Civil War period and Reconstruction.", "start_char_idx": 19078, "end_char_idx": 23731, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4560dc57-b86e-484e-b8d7-d3592e91bff0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4560dc57-b86e-484e-b8d7-d3592e91bff0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7317e044-ae8c-467a-8ce4-375e359ad769", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "27f5b8e496a1894e42f92f242655b768f5c62c1c5b2abfcc681e96c2a1a22522", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7d7338a-9c0e-46a1-ac3b-cdfbfed2fa59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Master.txt", "file_name": "Master.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29579, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "495f33822f4192fedc0136334f2f90aceaabbb8c7c50f75ea162085c2f4c3d7f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "02f4f371-33d1-4147-b43d-38d4ac873dfe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd5439e403845543f91ae23ebae726bca13b4daa7f814cc05e020643b1fabf4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Course topics will focus on the experiences of women in relation to identity, migration, representation, and economic development.MLAR 7240Justice, Law & Public Policy(3)This course will examine considerations of justice and morality that help shape law and public policy.\u00a0 Issues to be discussed may include:\u00a0 crime and punishment, drugs, gun control, treatment of enemy combatants, torture, surveillance and privacy, free speech and national security.MLAR 7245Medieval New Orleans(3)By way of numerous Power Point tours of on and off campus sites and materials, as well as our reading of a popular American novel, Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, this course will consider the influence of medieval culture and ideas on New Orleans and, to some extent, Southern culture in general, especially during the post-Civil War period and Reconstruction.  For instance, we will discuss medieval architectural styles preserved in Tulane and other local buildings (Richardsonian Romanesque and Gothic Revival), experience medieval music by New Orleans' Musica da Camera (a special guest performance), and explore real medieval manuscript materials from the Tulane Rare Books Room in Jones Hall.  We will also talk about medieval influences on such pre-Lenten festivals as Mardi Gras and on such regional foods as gumbo and turducken.  Class will conclude with our viewing of a musical film version of Connecticut Yankee, which suggests how Hollywood adapted medieval experience to bring it in line with certain nineteenth-century attitudes toward the Middle Ages. Three written assignments:  a midterm (essay format), short critical paper (5 typed pp.), and a final examination (on course terminology). Required Text:  Mark Twain, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur?s Court, ed. byMLAR Justin Kaplan (New York:  Penguin, 1972).MLAR 7247Shakespeare(3)What makes Shakespeare a great writer and why are some of his plays and poems judged to be greater than others in terms of their literary merits?  We will take up this twofold question by way of a discussion of some of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cgreatest hits,\u201d examples derived from each of his major literary genres.MLAR 7250Verbal and Visual Rhetoric(3)This course will focus on theories and practices of verbal discourse in comparison with visual imagery and technology.\u00a0 While concentrating on rhetorics of western cultures, some comparison will be made with rhetorical discourse and imagery in other cultures.\u00a0 The course will examine topics such as the interfaces of religion and politics, mass media and persuasive campaign, or the role of values in institutional leadership and issue campaigns.MLAR 7280Philosophy of Religion(3)This course examines various attempts to understand the nature and importance of religious experience and religious beliefs from a naturalistic perspective. We will discuss the ontological, epistemic, and axiological significance of claims about the nature of religious experience and religious beliefs in an attempt to situate these phenomena in a broader naturalistic understanding of the self and the world. After a consideration of the varieties of religious experience as exemplified in the work of William James, we will review arguments by Pascal Boyer and Daniel Dennett to the effect that the origin, development, and diversity of religious belief and religious experience are all phenomena that are scientifically explainable within the naturalistic frameworks of evolutionary biology and cognitive psychology.MLAR 7400Gender, Culture and Families(3)Research suggests that gender and family are inseparable concepts. Family carries particular gender role expectations at both the \u201cideal\u201d and the \u201cpractice\u201d level. However, we rarely think about what family is or how gender plays into family\u2014we simply take gendered family roles for granted. Yet where do our ideas about family and gender come from? This class will explore our perceptions of the gender-family nexus, and the changes that have occurred over the last half century or so, from the perspective of popular culture.MLAR 7451Religions of the World(3)This course will examine the teachings of several major religious traditions\u2014including Hinduism and Buddhism as well as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\u2014through selected readings from their sacred scriptures.MLAR 7500Independent Study(3)For specific topics, see Schedule of Classes.\nCourse may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99MLAR 7550Holocaust in Film & Literature(3)This course will consider the Holocaust, the attempted genocide of European Jewry by the Nazis during World War II, and the diverse ways that the events related to it are portrayed and understood by diverse audiences.

Even though most famous lead roles in opera are for women, operas until the twentieth  century have been predominantly written by men librettists and composers. They capture and prescribe the predominant values of modern Western patriarchy. In this course, we watch and listen to operas from 1600 to the present time. We pair the viewings with readings to answer the question: why do women so frequently die (and lie) in opera?MUSC 3430Blues In American Life(3)The blues, as both a musical form and a state of being, is the primary layer of African American culture.

Music has been a source of power for people subject to enslavement, legal segregation, and an ongoing struggle for political citizenship and economic equity. This course highlights the agency of black musicians and the political significance of the music they have created, from slave songs to hip-hop. This is a social and cultural history, and no musical training is required for understanding course materials.MUSC 3441Black Music Lab(1)This lab is for music majors, minors, or any other performing musicians who are enrolled in MUSC-3440 \u201cBlack Music, Black Lives.\u201d Students will discuss and perform the musical aspects of the material covered in that course. The two courses should be taken concurrently.Corequisite(s):MUSC\u00a03440.Course Limit:1MUSC 3450Music & Politics(3)Though often considered apart from social and political trends, music is central to thought and action in the public sphere. Whether in protest marches or in dance clubs, music challenges the belief that public opinion is expressed solely through language. We will concentrate on conflicts across lines of social identity: race, ethnicity, gender/sex, religion, and nationality. We will focus especially on racism against Black Americans in the U.S., anti-Semitism against Jews in Nazi Germany, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The course is open to all undergraduate students.MUSC 3460Music, Religion, Spirit(3,4)Music forms vital part of ritual for most religions around the world. In performing and listening to music, religious affiliates seek connection with the supernatural, foster community ties, and create tradition bridging past, present, and future. Furthermore, music gives religious groups visibility in the broader society, whether in live or recorded performance. This course explores the traditional musical practices of the three major monotheistic religions -Judaism, Christianity, Islam -followed by one unit on Indian religions, and one unit about of selected spiritual practices inherited from Africa currently practiced in the Americas, including voodoo, candomble, and Santeria. We will also critically look at historical and current social perceptions reacting to these musical practices and to their practitioners. This is a cultural history class; no musical training is required.MUSC 3480Music and Gender(3,4)In this course, we'll explore the relationship between gender and music in the West over the past 450 years. How have shifting rules and boundaries of gender identity interacted with similarly shifting rules and boundaries about beauty, function, and construction of music? In what ways has music helped to represent and/or define gender in culture? Further, how do gender identities intersect with other categories if social and cultural identity such as race, ethnicity, and class? This course will use a variety of case studies from popular and art music to explore the relationships between musical practice and gender identification, including: the courtesans and castrati of Baroque opera; Glam Rock; Clara Schumann, jazz singers; and Elvis Presley. Course open to both music majors and non-majors.MUSC 3700Contemporary Music Industry(3)MUSC 3890Service Learning(0-1)Students complete a service activity in the community in conjunction with the content of a three-credit co-requisite course.

We explore how the notion of indigenous musics arose in the late nineteenth century based on how it was collected and inscribed on specific sound and audiovisual formats, creating a racialized and colonial notion of indigenous musics.  Then we explore how indigenous peoples themselves, often in collaborative processes, are decolonizing and appropriating such histories by rethinking the early archives or documenting their own musics and sounds in new ways.", "start_char_idx": 13426, "end_char_idx": 18125, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bc0207b-791b-4e6d-a6a1-e365d6576dfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bc0207b-791b-4e6d-a6a1-e365d6576dfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Music.txt", "file_name": "Music.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31684, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ecf6bb15-a528-434b-89d5-cb63e590d03d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Music.txt", "file_name": "Music.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31684, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "1b3b1fac41ad2aefb1acc43e40e0f5bd371e16cea450c82e7cbf467b4d2192a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4c24f73-4be5-4a82-9f95-3524767375d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Music.txt", "file_name": "Music.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31684, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "1843e67715a9b775d3c61863e31279b6656dcbc16db6aac6c594623138b1d53c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dcd4ef9e-56b0-43bf-aa78-6205081ac2fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8989312d9f265bbf3d9a2262dc3d266e94d0789e3056a6651379362fbe4f1247", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Course may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99MUSC 3940Transfer Coursework(0-20)Transfer Coursework at the 3000 level.

We explore how the notion of indigenous musics arose in the late nineteenth century based on how it was collected and inscribed on specific sound and audiovisual formats, creating a racialized and colonial notion of indigenous musics.  Then we explore how indigenous peoples themselves, often in collaborative processes, are decolonizing and appropriating such histories by rethinking the early archives or documenting their own musics and sounds in new ways. In so doing, they challenge Western notions of musicality, of media inscription, of racialized histories of music, and how human and non-human sounds are understood. Graduate students: some readings in Spanish.MUSC 4330Music of the Latin American Outlaws(3,4)Music sounds loud and clear at the edge of law. From bandits to illegal immigrants, from underdogs to drug dealers, people who subscribe to their own rules reach out to our ears through song and dance. Their stories and sounds both fascinate and scare audiences well beyond their immediate surroundings, making their way to mass media and live events big and small. In this class, we will focus on Spanish-and Portuguese-speaking regions in the Americas, and our point of entry will be the music produced by and for groups or individuals who live(d) at the margin of law in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Your study time will be equally divided between learning and practicing aural skills and musical terminology, and critically reading texts of historical significance. In the long term, I hope that this course helps you look at any outlaw groups in new, more informed ways. I invite you to let the musics we will study challenge our preconceptions about Latin American cultures.MUSC 4400Music & Dsp(3)This course introduces the student to the breadth and depth of signal processing used in musical applications. The course will cover fundamentals of signal processing and familiarize the student with classic computer music theories as well as state-of-the art topics for sound synthesis, analysis, and computer music composition. Students work mostly in a graphical coding language for audiovisual applications called Pure Data.  No prior coding experience is required although experience with Matlab, Python or other languages translates well.  Pure Data is an excellent coding language for students interested in both creative applications and science and engineering projects.MUSC 4410Music Performance System(3)This Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course focuses on creative and innovative applications of engineering and design in the context of musical performance and composition.  Students learn about the history of technology as it relates to musical instrument design and music composition as they design their own custom instruments, synthesizers, and controllers.MUSC 4420Algorithmic & Comp Music(3)This course will be an exploration of computer music composition using various available techniques and state-of-the-art tools.

Even though most famous lead roles in opera are for women, operas until the twentieth  century have been predominantly written by men librettists and composers. They capture and prescribe the predominant values of modern Western patriarchy. In this course, we watch and listen to operas from 1600 to the present time. We pair the viewings with readings to answer the question: why do women so frequently die (and lie) in opera?MUSC 6210Chamber Music(3)MUSC 6230Keyboard Lit 1600-1750(3)MUSC 6240Keyboard Lit 1750-1970(3)MUSC 6250The German Lied(3)MUSC 6260The French Art Song(3)MUSC 6270Indigenous Media and Sound in Latin America(3)This course explores how indigenous musics and sounds have been inscribed into ethnographic media. We explore how the notion of indigenous musics arose in the late nineteenth century based on how it was collected and inscribed on specific sound and audiovisual formats, creating a racialized and colonial notion of indigenous musics. Then we explore how indigenous peoples themselves, often in collaborative processes, are decolonizing and appropriating such histories by rethinking the early archives or documenting their own musics and sounds in new ways. In so doing, they challenge Western notions of musicality, of media inscription, of racialized histories of music, and how human and nonhuman sounds are understood.

In this class, we will focus on Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking regions in the Americas, and our point of entry will be the music produced by and for groups or individuals who live(d) at the margin of law in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

As student progress through the dissection they will: 1) identify structures that surround and or cover the CNS; 2) log them in a course notebook and then dissect appropriate structures. Grading will be based upon participation, complete notebooks and final dissection results. (e.g., did you remove the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves as a single unit in reasonable condition?)\nNotes: Satisfies neuroscience laboratory requirement.

Theories to be examined include: relativism, subjectivism, egoism, moral realism, utilitarianism, Kantianism, contractualism, virtue theory, and Existentialism.PHIL 3590Greek Philo & Jewish Thought(3,4)Western culture has a double source, the Bible and Greek philosophy, or Jerusalem and Athens. Are the two traditions harmonious or do they stand in some essential tension with each other? This course will approach that question by examining the response of some important Jewish thinkers, Maimonides in particular, in their encounter with the teachings of Plato and Aristotle.PHIL 3640Philosophy of Law(3)A study of the character and justification of law and legal systems. Legal realism, legal positivism, and natural law theories are explored as are such law-related issues as punishment, the enforcement of morals, and the grounds of legal responsibility.PHIL 3650Crime and Punishment(3)This course offers a critical examination of philosophical issues involving crime and punishment. In the first half, we will ask what forms of behavior, if any, the state is entitled to declare to be criminal, focusing on such issues as drug abuse, prostitution, blackmail, gambling, hate speech, suicide, pornography, ticket scalping, insider trading, and gun control. In the second half, we will ask what forms of punishment, if any, the state is entitled to impose on those who violate those laws, if any, which are permissible, focusing on such issues as capital punishment, corporal punishment, and competing justifications of punishment in general.PHIL 3660Anarchy(3)This course examines diverse philosophic treatments of anarchy.

But what, if anything, guarantees the \u201cobjectivity\u201d of science? While we tend to think of our current scientific theories as providing us with knowledge, how do we know those theories will not be displaced by better ones, as theories in the past have been? Moreover, how should we reconcile the fact that science is geared towards knowledge with the fact that it is pursued by individuals with their own political aims, biases, and values? In this course, we will consider what characteristics of science allow for objective knowledge.PHIL 3740Consciousness(3)This course addresses questions such as the following: What is consciousness and why is it puzzling, if not mysterious? Is consciousness one phenomenon or many? What mechanisms and competencies underpin consciousness? Where (brain location)? Who are the possessors of consciousness, phylogenetically and ontogenetically? Why consciousness: its rationale and functions? How does consciousness emerge from matter (if at all)?PHIL 3750Philosophy of Cognitive Science(3,4)This course will serve as an overview to theoretical approaches and debates in cognitive science, viewed through a philosophical lens.PHIL 3760Interpreting Minds(3)A systematic introduction to the recent and dynamic interdisciplinary research area in naive psychology or theory of mind. The course begins with the philosophical debates about naive or folk psychology, then surveys the main empirical data, key experiments and hypotheses about ape and child interpretation of minds, and concludes with a comparative analysis of several much debated proposals about how the interpretation of minds is accomplished through innate mechanisms (modules), by simulation or in terms of a naive theory.PHIL 3765Imagination(3,4)This class is an advanced undergraduate overview of imagination, construed as cognitive competence.", "start_char_idx": 12624, "end_char_idx": 17064, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "483f3411-a19a-4fbd-bea3-126b9ecca2f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "483f3411-a19a-4fbd-bea3-126b9ecca2f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Philosophy.txt", "file_name": "Philosophy.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 32359, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af0e22b2-5344-48fd-a087-b78b9d20dbd2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Philosophy.txt", "file_name": "Philosophy.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 32359, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "6933542959a2894a9069e4bdb327c0041dd0a593f1fc783301c51f58a6b368b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b9a5585-32f4-4259-a233-3eff1bd0e926", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/gavingalusha/aidvisor2/app/data/Course_Data/Philosophy.txt", "file_name": "Philosophy.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 32359, "creation_date": "2024-06-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-14"}, "hash": "8a9496580b37cd64cc4a1f135ff9726fcdf1565fe0919bad95f73875761b243f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "460657e6-7c0b-484a-bcb4-607fd25464ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f2548fa052cdce077101f13c3ebcb42911a8d8cc9e70a46f2ac4da92a8fcfcb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Why consciousness: its rationale and functions?

In an interdisciplinary spirit, covering data and theories from philosophy, cognitive and developmental psychology as well as neuroscience, the class surveys such topics as the evolutionary reasons for imagination; the cognitive and cerebral mechanisms of imagination; the format of imaginative representations-pictorial versus symbolic; the ontogeny of imagination; and connections between imagination and reasoning, deliberation and foresight.PHIL 3800Language and Thought(3,4)An introduction to the philosophy of language and mental representation. Major topics: the relations between language and thought, models of mind, representation as computation, the language of thought, mental imagery, propositional attitudes, meaning and intentionality.PHIL 3850Terrorism(3)An examination of terrorism and counter terrorism with emphasis on moral issues.PHIL 3870Mind In Evolution(3)As any biological capacity, the mind must have evolved. Can evolution explain its design? The mind has many components, from perception to language and thinking. Are they all products of natural selection, of other evolutionary forces, or of no such forces at all? Can evolution explain the uniqueness of the human mind? What could be the factors that explain this uniqueness: tool making, language, social life? In attempting to answer these questions, the class brings an evolutionary perspective to some important topics in philosophy of mind and philosophical psychology and offers a multidisciplinary introduction to the emerging but rapidly developing field of evolutionary cognitive science.PHIL 3890Service Learning(0-1)Students complete a service activity in the community in conjunction with the content of a three-credit co-requisite course.

These nonclassical and quantum features of light have been shown to break the barriers imposed by classical physics in a variety of fields, such as communication, interferometry, computation, and imaging.  The main emphasis of this course will be to introduce these nonclassical features, quantize the electromagnetic field, introduce fundamental tests of quantum mechanics by use of optics, and explore the applications of nonclassical concepts such as entanglement.PHYS 6450Elem Particle Physics(3)An introduction to modern elementary particle physics, with an emphasis on the Standard Model, its phenomenology, and dynamics. The Standard Model explains, in principle and with remarkable success, virtually all phenomena that are observed in nature except gravity. The course begins with a qualitative examination of the electromagnetic, strong, and weak interactions and an introduction to the elementary particles through the use of Feynman diagrams. This is followed by relativistic kinematics, the quantum theory of angular momentum and spin, discrete symmetries, and bound states of leptons and quarks, with a focus on the hadrons. Finally the Dirac equation, the Feynman calculus, and the mathematical tools needed to calculate basic decay lifetimes and cross sections involving the electromagnetic and weak interactions are developed and applied.PHYS 6600Nanoscience & Technology(3)Nanoscience and technology is often branded the science of the 21st century. It has been promised that nanotechnology will have similar stimulating effects on the world's economy and society as the industrial-and microelectronics- revolution. Nanoscience is an interdisciplinary effort with the aim to manipulate and control matter at length scales down to single molecules and atoms and thus to create materials and devices with novel properties. With diminishing dimensions material properties are being governed by quantum mechanics. The description and exploitation of quantum phenomena in novel devices is the quintessence of nanophysics. Consequently, the main emphasis of this course is to give an overview of the physics of low dimensional solid state systems. This course is supplementary to courses in solid state physics and surface science but can be taken independently.PHYS 6660Special Topics(1-3)Special Topics.\nCourse may be repeated up to unlimited credit hours.Maximum Hours:99PHYS 6700Electrnc Prop of Materls(3)Quantum physics, electronics and energy bands in crystals, electronic transport in materials, photoconductivity, Hall effect, quantum Hall effect, superconductors and their applications, magnetic properties of material and their applications, thermal properties of materials and dielectric properties of materials.PHYS 6750Modern Cosmology(3)The Friedmann cosmological models: open, flat, and closed; matter and radiation dominated.

Positive political economy seeks to understand and predict policy outcomes and political behavior. The course will take an interdisciplinary approach that uses tools and concepts from economics to study politics and political behavior. The course will presume that political actors are rational and goal oriented. Using this approach, the course will examine how institutional constraints in the political environment affect the choices of these actors and the resulting political outcomes.\nPrerequisite(s):ECON\u00a01010, 1030.Prerequisite(s):ECON\u00a01010or 1030.PECN 3020Pol Ecn:Historical Ovrvw(3)This course introduces students to the question of how different modern Western societies and thinkers have defined the relationships between political and economic activities. Beginning with the experience of Europe in the 15th century, it examines what the unprecedented wealth of modern Western societies has meant for the understanding and practice of politics. It also explains what caused the economic abundance of Western nations to come into being in the first place, and how that abundance has been sustained over time.PECN 3030The Individual,Soc&State(3)This course presents an integrated study of the main alternatives in political ideology (liberalism, socialism, fascism, Marxism) advocated in the modern world and the exemplifications of these ideologies in practice in the modern world (post-war West Germany, 20th-century Britain, Mussolini's Italy, the former Soviet Union).PECN 3040Comp & Intl Pol Econ(3)Virtually all contemporary economies are characterized by extensive relations between the economic and political systems. Furthermore, these relations seem to involve often complex relations between the global, national, and sub-national political economies. This fact is currently referred to as globalization. However, it is clear that globalization, whatever it is, has different effect on national (and sub-national) political economies. In this course, we will: 1) attempt to develop an understanding of globalization; 2) develop a comparative analysis of the links between globalization and national outcomes; and 3) examine the international institutions that attempt to manage globalization.

We\u2019ll survey a range of topics which comprise the standard behavioral economic canon \u2014 focusing on ways in which individuals may systematically depart from assumptions such as perfect rationality, self interest, and \ntime consistency of decisions. It will examine models of non-standard preferences and decision rules, and discuss empirical strategies for distinguishing between such behavioral decision-making and the predictions of the standard model. Behavioral economics incorporates insights \nfrom social psychology, experimental economics, and sociology. Important areas of emphasis will be behavior towards risky outcomes, financial decision making, and applications to social institutions such as taxation and public finance, An important emphasis will be on how insights into behavioral economics can and should influence the design of public policy programs. \nPrerequisite(s):ECON\u00a03010.Prerequisite(s):ECON\u00a03010.PECN 4400Law & Economics of the Regulat(3)This course is designed to introduce students to the law and economics of the \nregulatory state and the challenges to governance posed by the regulatory state.

Students will be expected to develop an understanding of key legal principles as well as to apply economic analysis to legal rules. For each of the topics, a discussion of legal principles will be paired with the relevant economic analysis. \n\nThe first part of the course treats classic topics of law and economics. The aim here is to provide the key foundational material in contracts, torts, property, and administrative procedures. The questions to be addressed are the specifics of the legal rules and their impact on economic efficiency and welfare, \nbroadly defined. These tools are necessary in order to understand why there may need to be further government regulation. \n\nThe second part focuses on administrative law and the regulatory state. It will focus on why laws are written so as to permit action for regulatory agencies; the procedures that agencies and courts follow for regulations; and the limits of regulatory authority. There will be a careful look at case studies illustrating these principles.\nPrerequisite(s):ECON\u00a01010and3010.Prerequisite(s):ECON\u00a01010and3010.PECN 4560Internship(1-3)An experiential learning process coupled with pertinent academic course work.

The course is based on a management simulation in which teams of students compete against each other for business success within an industry while utilizing \u201creal-world\u201d decision making, strategy formulation, problem-solving, and competitive challenges. Teams must analyze the economic conditions of the simulated environment, insure smooth production, and understand their products relative to their customers, use accounting data to evaluate results and make decisions, finance operations, determine research and development targets, market products, manage employees and the team and respond to the competition.PMBA 7460Topics in Marketing(2)PMBA 7470Corporate Strategy(2)This course is designed to provide students with practice-oriented, nuanced, in- depth knowledge of the various aspects of the corporate strategy of the firm. \u201cCorporate strategy\u201d means managing the firm\u2019s scope \u2013 in other words, managing a corporation as a portfolio of businesses: What business units should the company have in order to maximize the shareholders\u2019 value? How should it acquire new lines of business? How should it divest the units it no longer wants? What should be the extent of the units\u2019 autonomy?The two primary objectives in this class are first to improve students\u2019 understanding of what makes a portfolio of businesses under a single corporate umbrella more or less valuable and second, to develop and hone the decision- making tools for properly structuring and executing acquisitions and alliances under different business situations.PMBA 7490Strategic HR Management(2)PMBA 7560Intro to Electricity Markets(2)The number of players in power markets, competing interests,  and evolving regulatory policy gives electricity markets a unique niche in the world of commodity trading. The unique physical characteristics of its product, coupled with the nature of its delivery (and associated constraints,)           have created opportunities for trading shops and major corporations to rise and fall in a little more than a decade.  As this market (slowly) matures, and regulation continues to improve market transparency and efficiency, it will be a bumpy ride. To better understand where these markets are going and where they have been, we shall first obtain a historical perspective. With a concrete understanding of the market evolution, we will then investigate what   variables (both physical and political) influence market prices on a long term, day ahead, and real time basis. We will also study the infamous market failures, and how regulators have responded to eliminate opportunities for indiscretion. The course will conclude with a brief look at several recent regulatory enactments to more closely align the interests of all market participants and stakeholders (and perhaps make the invisible hand seem more human!) This course will include market simulation exercises which will give students the opportunity to experience Power Marketing from the perspectives of a pure-marketer, independent power producer, and regulated utility.PMBA 7700Legal Enviro of Business(2)introduces the basic concepts of contracts, labor laws, discrimination, torts, partnership, corporations, securities, and bankruptcy and gives students an understanding of the relationships between parties in a typical business setting.

In the 21st century, rivers large and small are being increasingly managed for flood control, as a source of water (agricultural, industrial, potable), recreation and navigation, all of which can have system-wide environmental consequences. Future basin and global-scale climate changes must also be considered in management decisions. This course is designed to be a graduate and advanced undergraduate, interdisciplinary examination of river science and engineering practices that can serve as a springboard to more advanced coursework on the disciplinary aspects covered. It will also be useful to practitioners who require an interdisciplinary overview of river systems to more effectively perform their professional duties.RCSE 6802Introduction to Coastal Science and Engineering(3)With approximately 3 billion people living within 200 kilometers of the world\u2019s coastlines, coastal regions are home to a large and ever-growing population. A broad engineering knowledge is fundamental for the construction, protection, and maintenance of these coastal communities, and a good scientific understanding of the main underlying physical, chemical and ecological processes is particularly necessary considering the climatic changes we are facing in the 21st century. This course is designed to be a graduate and advanced undergraduate, interdisciplinary examination of coastal science and engineering practices that can serve as a springboard to more advanced coursework on the disciplinary\naspects covered. It will also be useful to practitioners who require an interdisciplinary overview of coastal systems to more effectively perform their professional duties.RCSE 6810River and Stream Restoration(3)Rivers and streams are complex ecosystems which have interconnected geologic, geomorphologic, chemical and biological underpinnings. As the demands of human populations have increased over the past several centuries, rivers and streams have often been pushed beyond their ability to maintain the dynamic equilibrium inherent to the system. In recent decades, in an attempt to restore some of the values and functions to these systems, river and stream restoration has emerged as a multi-billion-dollar industry. This course will cover the definitions of river and stream restoration, discuss the planning process associated with solid restoration efforts, present restoration techniques, discuss environmental flows as restoration measures, present commonly applied design concepts and consider how uncertainty, monitoring, and adaptive management may be applied to river and stream restoration efforts.Prerequisite(s):RCSE\u00a06800or SCEN 6800.RCSE 6820Introduction to River-Coastal Hydrologic and Hydraulic Modeling(3)Numerical models are effective and informative research, design, and planning tools.

This science is a critical, but often overlooked component, of any river management project. The River Mechanics and Management course introduces the student to a wide range of river topics related to the engineering and management of river systems. This includes an advanced examination of fluvial processes, channel stability concepts, sediment transport, and design considerations for commonly used engineering features. The course will also provide instruction on designing structural elements to aid in the management of river channels and floodplain. The course will emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of river science and engineering.Prerequisite(s):RCSE\u00a06800.RCSE 6840Methods in River Sampling(3)Tools and procedures developed for sampling and monitoring riverine systems over the last century are distinct from those developed for other aqueous environments. In addition to the need for tools tailored for systems of a wide range of size, energy, and setting, effective river monitoring also needs to capture highly episodic hydrographs that encompass large overbank areas during floods. River monitoring has profound implications in managing rivers for human use and for channel and riparian ecosystem health. Rivers are also highly sensitive to climate, and historical records of their behavior are a key indicator of changing climate on a basin and global scale. This course is designed to examine river sampling as conducted by agencies and academic researchers, including the use of remote sensing, and the collection of ecological, water chemistry, hydrological, sediment dynamics, and morphological evolution data sets. Historical data will be examined to define statistical data analytical procedures.Prerequisite(s):RCSE\u00a06800.RCSE 6850Estuarine Processes(3)Estuaries, where rivers meet the ocean, are among the most productive and dynamic systems on earth, and they are valued for recreation, habitat, and navigation. They are often located in areas with large populations, frequently resulting in intense competition for resources. This class will be taught to convey basic concepts that are important in estuary dynamics. It will include an introduction to estuarine ecology, descriptions of the generation of tides, tie wave propagation within the estuary, the role of salinity and density currents, estuarine sedimentation and an overview of navigation concerns. An emphasis will be placed on understanding the relationships between ecological and physical systems. The class will provide an understanding of ecosystem impacts as a result of physical changes in the estuary. Numerical models are the standard approach for investigating estuary behavior and will be used as a construct to understand estuaries, but prior knowledge of modeling is not required.Prerequisite(s):RCSE\u00a06800.RCSE 6860Environmental Data Analysis in the Anthropocene(3)Scientists, engineers, and planners are increasingly faced with the challenges of a changing environment. These changes can be climate change related \u2013 and associated with factors such as sea-level rise, droughts, or heavy precipitation \u2013 or result from more local human overprints of the natural landscape (e.g., changes in land use, dredging of rivers, flood protection measures). But they all require, more than ever, tailored data analysis tools to capture transient behaviors, non-stationarity, and new equilibria. This class equips students with the probability, data, and time series analysis tools that they need to interpret a wide range of environmental data - from lab measurements to field observations.Prerequisite(s):RCSE\u00a06800or6802.RCSE 6870Hydroclimatology(3)The course will cover four major themes and their specific methods.

At the New Orleans Charter High School for Science and Math (SciHi), founded by two Tulane professors, the students are motivated but the disparities in their backgrounds are enormous. In this course, we learn how to help high school students who've fallen behind, both academically and by understanding the origins of their difficulty. Then we apply that knowledge by working with the students and also fulfilling one of the Tulane Center for Public Service requirements. The service, a minimum of 30 hours over the course of a semester, can take the form of teaching, tutoring, assisting with in-class exercises, and always includes acting as a mentor and role model to the SciHi students.Corequisite(s):SCEN\u00a01890.SCEN 1015Computers & Musical Creativity(3)For high school students enrolled in the TSSP summer program.SCEN 1020Comm Sci:1st Lego League(1)If you are looking for a service learning opportunity this fall, in this course, you will mentor a middle-school robotics team using FIRST LEGO League (FLL) as a platform. Typically run on-site as an after-school program, FLL provides motivation in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) by requiring middle-school students to design and build a LEGO robot and prepare a 5-minute research presentation on the theme of the challenge. Past themes have involved Trash/Recycling, Natural Disasters, Senior Citizens, Biomedical Engineering, Climate, Energy, and Nanotechnology.

We take a historical and contextual perspective of the field to assess changemaking strategies in service of more just and equitable societies. We will explore different change strategies that changemakers can use to tackle wicked problems in society, such as social innovation and social entrepreneurship, social advocacy and activism, and social service provision. Students will have the opportunity to explore social impact organizations in the private, public, and citizen sectors. We will also discuss various facets of environmental, financial, and social sustainability.Prerequisite(s):SISE\u00a02011*.*May be taken concurrently.Corequisite(s):SISE\u00a03890.SISE 3041Leading Change(5)For real change to happen, there needs to be effective leadership. This course dives into unpacking and formulating what it takes for effective leadership to ensure positive social and environmental change. Students in this course will study the theory and practice of leadership, why leadership is vital to changemaking, and learn from respected leaders and relevant case studies rooted in social change. Students will also assess their personal leadership strengths and weaknesses, practice the art of leading, and create a vision and design for their own leadership as change makers.SISE 3042Social Entrepreneurship(3)Grounded on theories and practice of social entrepreneurship, or the process of developing new and innovative opportunities that directly address social and environmental issues, this course highlights the importance of understanding business planning and economic concepts for organizations. The course will assess different business models for social impact organizations and how these organizations integrate their social mission with their business strategies. Students will consider the necessary business skills required of social entrepreneurs and others working to make positive, systemic, sustainable change in communities around the world.SISE 3210The Arts and Social Impact(3)Pablo Picasso once said, \u201cEvery child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.\u201d The purpose of this course is to examine the value of the arts in society, and more specifically the linkages between the arts, creative problem solving, and social impact. The capacity for artistic expression is one of the defining characteristics of being human. Yet, the arts are systematically devalued in public schools. And the myth of the \u201cstruggling artist\u201d perpetuates the idea of the artist as an outcast. Drawing from multiple perspectives, we will explore the unique ways the arts contribute to social impact. We will discuss theories, read scholarly articles, examine case studies, and hear from guest speakers in the local arts community. We will specifically investigate the relationship between art and social impact in terms of (a) arts education, (b) social movements, and (c) economic and community development. Attention will be given to the ways artistic expression intersects with structures of class, gender, race, and geography.SISE 3310Facilitating Social Justice(3)This practicum is a requirement for ongoing participation in the Community Engagement Advocates program and requires applied work in facilitating\nsocial justice dialogues.

From fantasy and horror to science fiction, Afrofuturism, cultural commentary, alternative histories and dystopian scenarios, the genre(s) of speculative fiction depict worlds that don\u2019t exist \u2013 yet! Through intergalactic encounters, time travel, magic, advanced technologies and more, speculative fiction offers powerful critiques of our current social and environmental systems as well as alternative visions of many possible, and more inclusive worlds. These alternatives allow us to explore and critically analyze what more just, sustainable, liberating, and equitable realities might look like, and how we might imagine them into being through processes of social innovation. This class will engage with literary, musical, and cinematic works of speculative fiction with a focus on works by artists of color, who are using speculation to challenge the status quo and combat marginalization\u2014such as those by N.K.

Students will critically reflect on and consolidate their knowledge and understanding of the SISE field. Through critical discussion around specific themes relevant to SISE, seminar participants will forge a deeper understanding of SISE as an approach to addressing social problems, its potential, and the nature of its critiques. A primary goal of the SISE minor is to help students embody the design thinking skills of empathy, listening, and humility and collaboration, with a focus on social impact (rather than profit or self-promotion). To that end, the class sessions offer a forum for engaging in meaningful reflection on major topics and themes studied throughout the semester and the opportunity to relate that to student\u2019s individual experiences. The class will also help students cement their network of current and future thought partners, including peers, classmates, instructors, and guest lecturers.

E. B. Du Bois made his prescient statement, on the launch of his seminal book The Souls of Black Folk: \u201cthe problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color-line.\u201d Can we make this claim in the Twenty-First Century? To answer this question, we will compare race and ethnic relations in the United States, with a focus on understanding how race and racism shape our lives. We will discuss historical accounts of the social constructs of race and ethnic groups and examine current issues of individual, institutional, and systemic racism, media representations of race and ethnicity, racialized forms of migration, racial inequalities, and environmental racism. We will also make connections between race, gender, and social class to understand how they work together in creating inequalities and shaping our identities.PASO 2200Environment & Society(3)There is no relationship more important to society than the one we have with our natural environment. From how we extract natural resources necessary for everyday life to where we put our waste products, from how we produce our food to where we go on vacation, our dependence on and perceptions of the environment are fundamental to every aspect of our lives. This course focuses on society-environment relations across the globe. We begin by reading about and discussing some conceptual issues that are central to our understanding of society-environment relations. These include the concept of sustainability, environmental resources, political economy, social construction of nature, and environmental justice. We then examine several important society-environment relations, including energy use, agriculture and food, and conservation.PASO 2912Special Topics(3)Special Topics in Sociology.

Often, this lay usage of \"research\" refers to doing some internet searches and watching YouTube videos; these searches and video viewings often result in the person justifying an existing belief, as the person chooses sources that align with what she or he already thinks.  As you will learn in this course, that is not research.  Research is a systematic endeavor.  The researcher uses established practices to test an idea or hypothesis or generate a new theory. Evidence gathered through research may disconfirm a hypothesis. Because \"research\" has taken on this lay usage, it is important to become knowledgeable about what research is, what practices constitute research, and how one can assess the quality of research.  This course will introduce you to the concept of research, research terminology, research ethics, and various research methods. For each method, you will learn about the strengths and limitations of each approach and what types of research questions a method can (and cannot) address.PASO 3100Urban Space Place & Inequality(3)This course explores the theoretical and methodological formulations of space and place and their relevance for sociological and social analyses. We will study the relationship of space/place to inequality as manifested in different guises around the world: spatial polarization, architecture, urban planning and design, spatial integration, symbolic space, etc. Throughout the course, we will pay close attention to how space and place intersect with inequality and how challenges to inequality are leveled through spatial approaches. How does the urban experience vary for different groups of people (by gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality)? Why? What explains the processes of urbanization and suburbanization? Who controls public space? How do different cities respond to the needs of the poorest residents, and what shapes these responses? How did (do) cities around the world come to develop and grow? What is the role of gentrification? These are some of the questions we\u2019ll address in this course.PASO 3200Sociology of Travel and Tourism(3)This course examines the relationship between tourism and social life from a sociological perspective, the root idea being that it is natural for human beings to make contact with other human beings and societies to create leisure institutions to engage in cultural exchange and enjoyment.

This course will examine tourist practices and how they are shaped and made meaningful within a social context. As we investigate why people travel, how they travel, and what they do while they are \u201con the road,\u201d we will see that tourism is not on the margins of the social world, but rather profoundly interconnected with everyday social life, from the personal to the global. Through readings, discussing, and writing, we will explore the ways tourism is a material, symbolic, and political representation of many of the features of contemporary society\u2019s achievements and ills: modernity and postmodernity, consumption and cultural commoditization, the aestheticization of everyday life, democratization and social inequalities, questions of authenticity, embodiment and identity, gender relations, technology, social mobility and power, and globalization.PASO 3210Global Inequality(3)This course introduces students to the relations among globalization and inequality and globalization, with a focus on implications for the developing world. Among topics for study are the world distribution of income, across and within countries; concepts of inequality (income, opportunity, mobility, capabilities, horizontal inequality); the implications of global trade and capital markets for inequality within developing countries; the consequences of inequality for growth and for political institutions in developing countries; the effects of global market failures and differences among countries in economic power on trade, capital, intellectual property, international migration, climate and other global regimes; and the role of global economic institutions (IMF, World Bank, bilateral aid programs) in addressing unequal opportunity and global market failures.PASO 3220Brazilian Society(3)This course is designed as an interdisciplinary and critical introduction to the history, society, literature, and culture of Brazil, the largest nation of Latin America. Students will learn about Brazil\u2019s colonial experience as the only Portuguese colony in the Americas, its unique experiment with monarchical institutions in the nineteenth century, and the trajectory of its uneven modernization in the twentieth century. The course will examine diverse topics including contemporary race relations, gender, sexuality, religion and spirituality, class conflict, migration, and various aspects of Brazilian cultural production and performance, as reflected in film, music, literature, and other forms of popular culture.PASO 3230Sociology of Gentrification(3)Why are rents up? Where are all the people who used to live in this neighborhood? Why was your favorite coffee shop replaced by a bank? What exactly is a hipster? These are all questions swirling around the topic of gentrification. Ruth Glass coined the term \u201cgentrification\u201d in 1964 to describe changes she was seeing in London, in particular the fact that \u201cone by one, many of the working class quarters of London have been invaded by the middle classes.\u201d A physical and social transformation of urban neighborhoods, gentrification might have gotten its name in the 1960s, but it has its roots in social processes that run from the early twentieth century through today. In this class, we will explore the causes and consequences of gentrification, with a focus on the United States. In addition to thinking about what gentrification is, we will think about how urban theorists have conceived of gentrification, and how these conceptions shape debates on the contentious topic.PASO 3300Socio Health & Mental Illness(3)This course offers an introduction to sociological theories and research related to health and illness, with a focus on mental health and mental illness. Although many people think of mental illness as under the purview of healthcare providers (and psychiatrists and psychologists for mental illness), sociologists have made significant contributions to our understanding and conceptions of health, illness, and mental illness.PASO 3911Special Topics(3)Special Topics in Sociology.

Fields covered will include business, politics, non-profit work, and social movements - all highlighting decision making in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. In most class periods, you will be asked to \u201cinhabit\u201d the case and take up the dilemma of its protagonist. I may assign class members roles to prepare and play in the class discussion spontaneously or in advance. None of the cases have right answers, although we may have an epilogue that tells what actually happened (the historical outcome). You are asked to wrestle with the problem as if it were your own and bring your experience and classroom learning from Tulane University and elsewhere to bear on the questions. The Harvard Business School originated and developed the phenomenon of the teaching case to simulate business experience in novices, to create a concrete vehicle for applying abstract theories to real-world situations, and to engender engaged classroom discussion while fostering critical thinking skills as students were forced to wrestle with actual business dilemmas that had no easy answer. It is no accident that professional schools were drawn to case teaching\u2014Law, for obvious reasons\u2014but also schools of public affairs and public health whose missions are to utilize the best thinking of the disciplines to prepare students for careers as practitioners. Cases marry learning about real world policy and organizational problems with critical thinking, abstract reasoning, and theorizing valued in all academic disciplines. In particular, this course will offer you a chance to get to know New Orleans as a resilient city with monumental challenges left to tackle.TIDR 1090Who Dat, Fan Up & Geaux(1)Founded in 1718, the city of New Orleans has a long and rich history with sports. From the rise of social class-driven sports such as rowing and billiards to the New Orleans Saints\u2019 heroic revival of the city post-Hurricane Katrina, sports has been as integral to the area as food, music, and Mardi Gras. Sports have made an enduring impact on the social world in which we all live. It is a taken for granted aspect of our everyday lives \u2013 whether that entails watching \u201cSportscenter\u201d or noticing that every single major newspaper contains a \u201cSports\u201d section that is as long if not longer than any other section. Yet there is more to sport than just what we see on a daily basis. In this course, we will explore general sports-related topics and examine actual case studies related to New Orleans\u2019 sports scene. More than simply \u2018talking sports,\u2019 students will study issues from political, economic and social viewpoints and also gain an understanding of the rich sports heritage found here in New Orleans. Readings and discussions, field trips, and guest speakers will aid students to understand both historical accounts and modern-day subjects associated with sports such as governmental involvement, public financing, and community development. Students will participate in a mandatory service learning component with TBD. Their after-school programs promote development in boys and girls through activities that build character, cultivate new skills, and create a sense of belonging \u2013 in this case a place where kids can express themselves, play together and get fit. By participating in activities with NFL Youth Education Town students will deepen their understanding of the political, economic, and social ramifications of sports on a local level by making correlations to sports and its impacts on the city\u2019s youth, infrastructure, civic pride, crime reduction efforts, poverty eradication, and other areas, and gain an awareness of their role as a citizen in the city of New Orleans.TIDR 1117N.

O. Performance Culture(1)There will be two primary goals in this course. The first will involve introducing students to New Orleans\u2019s history, culture, and literature. The second will entail an interdisciplinary introduction to a wide array of influences with the effort of showing how New Orleans\u2019s turbulent history of changing possession, immigration, and migration have contributed to a \u201cperformance\u201d of various versions of \u201cNew Orleansness.\u201d The course will focus specifically on the presence of French, Spanish, African, and a brief overview of the various immigrant communities in the city\u2019s history and the various ways in which these groups have performed their own version of New Orleans for the city itself, the United States, and the world. In addition, the students will use the maps found in Unfathomable City: A New Orleans Atlas to look at how maps are constructions of authenticity.TIDR 1225Women in STEM(1)This course covers the challenges facing women pursuing degrees and careers in STEM. Many of these challenges are institutionalized barriers that still exist, creating a system in which it is harder for women to thrive in comparison with their male peers. Other minority groups in STEM face many of the same challenges as women, and the additional and different barriers for other underrepresented groups will also be discussed. The course will cover strategies for success in STEM and becoming an ally and advocate for other traditionally marginalized groups in STEM.TIDR 1265Indian Tribes on the Bayou(1)Want to explore the wilds of Louisiana outside of New Orleans?

The far-reaching impact of Native American Tribes of the lower Mississippi Valley on shaping Louisiana history is among the least explored subjects among the otherwise well-documented rich history of Louisiana. Recent and ongoing research shows that without the \u201cPetit Nations\u2019\u201d, as some of the Tribes were called, the history of this region would have been quite different. This course offers students the rare opportunity to participate in on-going, important research that entails working directly with Tribal members. In addition, students will have the opportunity to take a trip conducted by Tribal members down the bayous as they give a tour of their ancestral lands as well as explore other areas of Louisiana outside of New Orleans while also tasting some of the food native to Louisiana.
