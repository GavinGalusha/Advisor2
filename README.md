**Python Flask RAG Chatbot**
**Project Overview**
This project is a Python Flask-based chatbot application that provides users with both academic and general advice. The chatbot utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to generate text responses based on user input. The application is designed to offer a user-friendly web interface, deployed on Heroku at advisor2-d49f8063f5fb.herokuapp.com.

**Key Features**
**User Interface**
The web interface is built using Flask and provides an easy-to-use platform for users to interact with the chatbot. Users can input their queries and receive responses directly on the web page.

**Session Management**
The application maintains user sessions to keep track of the conversation history. This ensures that users can have continuous and coherent interactions with the chatbot. The session management is handled seamlessly within the Flask application, storing the conversation context and user preferences.

**Text Generation and Handling**
The core functionality of generating responses is powered by OpenAI's GPT models. The responses are processed and formatted into HTML before being displayed to the user, ensuring a clean and readable output.

**Database Integration**
User-provided advice is collected and stored in a database. The application uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions, ensuring robust and efficient data management. This feature allows the chatbot to learn from user inputs and potentially improve its advice over time.

**Input Validation and Sanitization**
To maintain the integrity and security of the application, all user inputs are validated and sanitized. This includes removing potentially harmful HTML tags and limiting the input length to prevent abuse.

**Environment Configuration**
The application configuration, including API keys and database URLs, is managed using environment variables loaded from a .env file. This practice enhances security by keeping sensitive information out of the source code.

**RAG Processes with LlamaIndex**
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) processes are implemented using LlamaIndex. This involves creating and managing separate indexes for academic and general advice data. The LlamaIndex library helps in efficiently storing and retrieving documents, which are then used to provide contextually relevant responses. The setup process involves reading documents from specified directories, creating indexes, and then using these indexes to generate responses based on user queries.

**Setup and Deployment**
The chatbot is deployed on Heroku, making it accessible from anywhere with internet access. The deployment process involves setting up the necessary environment variables on Heroku and ensuring that the application can run smoothly in the cloud environment.
